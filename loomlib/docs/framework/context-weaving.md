# Context as Weaving

**Type:** Domain Framework
**Perspective:** Linguistic Recovery
**Source:** Latin contextus, from con- (together) + texere (to weave)

## The Excavation

Context is not a container. It's not "background information." The word comes from weaving — *contextus*, the joining together of threads.

Context is what you weave together. Every element added creates relational possibilities with every other element present. The text is the fabric. The context is the weaving that produced it.

## The Drift

Modern usage: "Let me give you some context" = "Here's background information"

This treats context as a container you pour information into. But weaving is active. You don't have context; you make it. The quality of the weave determines what can be seen.

## The Distinction

| Context as Container | Context as Weaving |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Information added | Relations created |
| Static background | Active production |
| More is better | Quality of weave matters |
| Precedes the work | Is the work |
| Neutral | Shapes what's sayable |

## The Operational Meaning

If context is weaving:
- Adding information isn't automatically helpful — a bad thread ruins the fabric
- The order of introduction matters — weaving is sequential
- Some contexts make things visible that others hide — the loom constrains the pattern
- Context is a skill, not a state — you get better at weaving

## Application to Conversation

Every conversation weaves a context. The elements present create relational possibilities:
- What vocabulary is live?
- What frameworks are active?
- What's salient vs. backgrounded?
- What's speakable within this weave?

The production model: **Context is the loom. The artifact is the fabric.**

The loom constrains what patterns are possible. Choosing what to weave into context is choosing what can be made.

## Deployment

When preparing for thinking, writing, or dialogue:
1. What threads do I need present? (Not "what information" — what *active elements*)
2. What order of introduction creates the best relational field?
3. What should stay out? (Some threads tangle the weave)
4. What becomes visible/sayable with this context that wasn't before?
5. The governing question: What does this make salient?
