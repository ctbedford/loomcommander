# The Four Knowings

**Type:** Domain Framework
**Perspective:** Philosophical Genealogy
**Source:** Vervaeke, Awakening from the Meaning Crisis

## The Framework

Knowing is not one thing. Four distinct types, each with its own acquisition path and failure mode:

| Type | Character | Acquired By | Lost By |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Propositional** | That — facts, claims, information | Study, instruction | Forgetting, misinformation |
| **Procedural** | How — skills, capacities, abilities | Practice, repetition | Atrophy, interference |
| **Perspectival** | What — salience, attention, what stands out | Exposure, habituation | Flattening, wrong salience |
| **Participatory** | Who — identity, mutual recognition, being known | Relationship, initiation | Alienation, broken recognition |

## The Integration Problem

Modern education privileges propositional knowing almost exclusively. You can know *that* the French Revolution happened, but not *how* to think historically, not *what* matters about it, not *who* you become by engaging with it.

Wisdom requires integration across all four. Information without capacity is trivia. Capacity without salience is technique. Salience without identity is observation. Identity without information is delusion.

## The Diagnostic Application

For any learning, skill, or transformation:

**Propositional:** What facts, concepts, vocabulary must be acquired?
**Procedural:** What must be practiced until fluent?
**Perspectival:** What should become salient that wasn't before?
**Participatory:** Who do you become? What community recognizes this?

## Context Across the Four Knowings

Context itself operates differently at each level:

| Knowing Type | Context Function | What Good Context Does | Degradation Mode |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Propositional | Information present | Right facts available | Overload, contradiction |
| Procedural | Capacities activated | Right skills live | Wrong skills active, skill absence |
| Perspectival | Salience landscape | Right things stand out | Undifferentiated field, false salience |
| Participatory | Conditions of mutual knowing | Genuine dialogue possible | Broken participation, mutual confusion |

## The Curriculum Pattern

Part I (Philosophical Genealogy) gave: vocabulary for meaning, salience for fragmentation, genealogical method
Part II (Linguistic Recovery) gives: etymological procedure, salience for drift, loving attention to texts
Part III (Economic Genealogy) will give: reading financial structures, salience for arrangements and positions
Part IV (Legal Grammar) will give: drafting and interpreting, salience for what binds and enforces

Each part develops all four knowings, but with different emphasis.

## Deployment

When designing learning, evaluating understanding, or diagnosing confusion:
1. Identify which knowing type is at stake
2. Check if the acquisition method matches the knowing type
3. Look for integration failures — strong in one type, absent in others
4. The governing question applies: What does this make salient?
