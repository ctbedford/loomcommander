# Etymon Method

**Type:** Toolkit Framework
**Function:** Excavate degraded concepts through philological analysis

## The Structure

**Excavation → Drift → Recovery**

Each video follows this arc. The excavation uncovers what the word originally meant — not as trivia, but as operational capacity that was once available. The drift traces how that meaning degraded, usually through abstraction, institutionalization, or metaphor collapse. The recovery asks: what would it look like to have this capacity back?

## The Operators

Operators structure the excavation. They're not exhaustive — they're generative.

| Operator | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **VERSUS** | Draws distinction | Oikonomia VERSUS Chrematistics |
| **AS** | Recovers original sense | Tutor AS guardian |
| **WITHOUT** | Names what's lost | Credit WITHOUT trust |
| **BEFORE** | Temporal excavation | Alliance BEFORE empire |
| **FROM** | Traces derivation | Capital FROM cattle |
| **FOR** | Names the telos | Education FOR what? |
| **TO** | Direction of drift | Inquiry TO record |
| **THROUGH** | Method of recovery | Meaning THROUGH etymology |
| **WITHIN** | Situates in context | Economy WITHIN household |
| **AGAINST** | Marks opposition | Accumulation AGAINST limits |
| **OF** | Genitive relation | History OF history |
| **BEHIND** | What's concealed | The body BEHIND corporation |
| **AND** | Conjunction that reveals | Debt AND guilt |
| **OR** | False equivalence | Wealth OR money |

## The Question

Not "what does this word mean?" but "what capacity did this word once carry that we no longer have access to?"

## Deployment

When producing an Etymon instance:
1. Identify the degraded term
2. Excavate the etymological root (Latin, Greek, or further)
3. Reconstruct the operational meaning
4. Trace the drift mechanism (how did it degrade?)
5. Articulate what recovery would look like
6. Select the operator that best structures the excavation
