# Institutional Founding Method

**Type:** Toolkit framework (⚙) — operative method you *do*

**Purpose:** A method for founding institutions — not merely advocating for them, but actually causing them to stand. Moves from "what policy should exist" to "how to institute something durable."

**Core insight:** The word "institution" comes from Latin *instituere* — "to cause to stand." Founding is an *act*. This method provides the operative sequence for that act.

---

## The Founding Problem

Most policy work produces *advocacy* — arguments for what should exist. But arguments don't stand. Institutions stand. The gap between advocacy and institution is the founding gap.

| Policy Work | Founding Work |
|-------------|---------------|
| "This should exist" | "I am causing this to stand" |
| Paper/proposal | Organization/structure |
| Ideas | Personnel |
| Argument | Coalition |
| Persuasion | Durability |

**The question this method answers:** How do you move from vision to standing institution?

---

## Core Distinction

**Founding vs. Reform vs. Advocacy**

| Mode | Question | Action | Product |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Advocacy** | "What should exist?" | Argue | Papers, speeches |
| **Reform** | "How do we fix this?" | Adjust | Modified institution |
| **Founding** | "How do I cause this to stand?" | Institute | New institution |

This method is for **founding** — creating something new that will persist. It can be applied to:
- Creating entirely new institutions
- Re-founding captured/corrupted institutions
- Establishing sub-institutions within existing structures

---

## Method

### Phase 1: Vision Crystallization

**Purpose:** Move from vague desire to articulable founding vision.

**Steps:**

1. **State the telos in one sentence.**
   - What is this institution *for*?
   - Not what it does, but what purpose it serves
   - Test: Would the founder risk something for this purpose?

2. **Name the household.**
   - Who is the *oikos* this institution serves?
   - Nation? Community? Profession?
   - The household defines accountability

3. **Identify the absence.**
   - What fails to happen without this institution?
   - What gap in the world does it fill?
   - The absence is the founding justification

4. **Articulate the limit.**
   - What would "success" look like?
   - When has the institution done enough?
   - Without limit, you have chrematistic drift

**Output:** Vision statement — one paragraph that captures telos, household, absence, and limit.

**Test:** Can someone who wasn't present understand what you're founding and why?

---

### Phase 2: Theory Development

**Purpose:** Build the legitimating framework that explains why this institution is necessary.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify the objections.**
   - What will opponents say?
   - "This already exists" / "Markets handle this" / "Government shouldn't do this" / "This will be captured"
   - List the three strongest objections

2. **Develop responses.**
   - For each objection, articulate the response
   - Not just "you're wrong" but principled argument
   - Draw on existing theory where applicable (Hamilton, List, etc.)

3. **Extract principles.**
   - What principles guide this institution's operation?
   - Not rules (which become procedure) but principles (which enable judgment)
   - Principles allow adaptation without losing purpose

4. **Connect to tradition.**
   - What precedents exist?
   - What successful institutions does this resemble?
   - Tradition provides legitimacy and templates

**Output:** Founding theory — document that explains necessity, answers objections, states principles, cites precedents.

**Test:** Could a defender use this document to argue for the institution in hostile territory?

---

### Phase 3: Structure Design

**Purpose:** Design the form that will stand — legal, organizational, procedural.

**Steps:**

1. **Define jurisdiction.**
   - What is this institution responsible for?
   - What is explicitly *not* its responsibility?
   - Clear jurisdiction prevents mission creep and turf wars

2. **Choose legal form.**
   - Government agency? Non-profit? Hybrid?
   - What charter/incorporation is needed?
   - Legal form determines constraints and capabilities

3. **Design internal organization.**
   - What roles are needed?
   - What hierarchy? (Or: what alternative to hierarchy?)
   - How are decisions made?

4. **Specify relationship to existing structures.**
   - Where does this sit in the governance landscape?
   - What existing institutions does it interact with?
   - Who has oversight?

5. **Build purpose into procedure.**
   - How do procedures reinforce the telos?
   - What prevents procedure from substituting for purpose?
   - The structure should *teach* the purpose (the original sense of institution)

**Output:** Structural design — document specifying jurisdiction, legal form, organization, relationships, and purpose-serving procedures.

**Test:** Could someone implement this structure without you? Would they understand the purpose from the procedures?

---

### Phase 4: Coalition Building

**Purpose:** Assemble the political support needed for the institution to survive attack.

**Steps:**

1. **Map interests.**
   - Who benefits materially from this institution?
   - Producers? Workers? Communities?
   - Material interest creates durable support

2. **Identify ideological allies.**
   - Who shares the underlying beliefs?
   - What existing movements/groups align?
   - Ideology provides principled support

3. **Find leadership.**
   - Who can navigate political opposition?
   - Who has credibility with the coalition?
   - Leadership provides direction and defense

4. **Build organization.**
   - How does the coalition mobilize?
   - What structures exist or need to be created?
   - Organization turns interest into action

5. **Anticipate fracture lines.**
   - How could opponents divide the coalition?
   - What internal tensions exist?
   - Address fracture lines before opponents exploit them

**Output:** Coalition map — document identifying interests, allies, leadership, organizational structures, and vulnerabilities.

**Test:** If the institution is attacked, who shows up to defend it? Do you know their names?

---

### Phase 5: Reproduction Design

**Purpose:** Ensure the institution can perpetuate itself across generations.

**Steps:**

1. **Design personnel pipeline.**
   - Where will operators come from?
   - What training do they need?
   - How do you attract people with the right orientation?

2. **Build knowledge transmission.**
   - What must operators know?
   - How is this knowledge taught?
   - Documents? Apprenticeship? Formal training?

3. **Embed cultural transmission.**
   - How do operators absorb the *purpose*, not just the procedures?
   - What rituals/practices reinforce the telos?
   - Culture carries purpose when documents are forgotten

4. **Create adaptation mechanisms.**
   - How does the institution learn?
   - How does it change without losing identity?
   - Rigidity kills; dissolution of identity also kills

**Output:** Reproduction plan — document specifying personnel sources, training, cultural transmission, and adaptation.

**Test:** If you disappeared, could the institution continue? Would it still be recognizable in 20 years?

---

### Phase 6: Founding Act

**Purpose:** Execute the founding — actually cause the institution to stand.

**Steps:**

1. **Secure initial resources.**
   - What funding/resources are needed to begin?
   - Who provides them? With what conditions?
   - Initial resources enable launch; sustainable resources enable persistence

2. **Recruit founding personnel.**
   - Who are the first operators?
   - Do they understand the purpose?
   - Founding personnel set the culture

3. **Execute legal formation.**
   - File the incorporation/charter
   - Establish the legal existence
   - The institution now *stands* in law

4. **Launch operations.**
   - Begin doing the work
   - The institution now *stands* in practice
   - First operations establish precedent

5. **Survive first attack.**
   - Someone will oppose this
   - The coalition must mobilize
   - Surviving attack proves the institution stands

**Output:** Standing institution — not a document but a reality.

**Test:** Does it exist? Is it operating? Has it survived opposition?

---

## Post-Founding: Maintenance and Defense

Founding is only the beginning. The institution must:

1. **Monitor all five elements** — Vision drift? Theory attacks? Structural capture? Coalition fracture? Reproduction failure?

2. **Defend when attacked** — Which element is under attack? Mobilize appropriate response.

3. **Adapt without dissolving** — Change procedures as needed, but preserve purpose.

4. **Extend and deepen** — Build additional capacity as institution matures.

---

## Application Protocol

### For New Institution Founding

Work through all six phases in order:
1. Vision Crystallization
2. Theory Development
3. Structure Design
4. Coalition Building
5. Reproduction Design
6. Founding Act

Each phase builds on previous. Don't skip phases — an institution missing any element will fail.

### For Re-Founding (Captured/Corrupted Institution)

1. Diagnose which elements failed (using Institutionalization Elements framework)
2. Determine if re-founding is possible or if new institution is needed
3. If re-founding: Work through phases to rebuild failed elements
4. If new institution: Work through all phases; plan for displacement of corrupted predecessor

### For Sub-Institution (Within Existing Structure)

1. Adapt phases to nested context
2. Phase 3 (Structure) must fit within host institution
3. Phase 4 (Coalition) must include internal allies
4. Phase 6 (Founding Act) may be administrative rather than legal

## Boundary Conditions

### When to Use This Method

- You have a vision for something that should exist durably
- You're willing to commit resources and effort beyond advocacy
- You have or can build a coalition
- The context permits institution-building (not all contexts do)

### When NOT to Use This Method

- You just want to argue for something (use advocacy)
- The existing institution is reformable (use reform)
- You lack any coalition potential (build coalition first)
- The context is too hostile for any institution to stand (change context first)

### Time Horizon

Institutional founding is **generational** work. Expect:
- Vision crystallization: weeks to months
- Theory development: months
- Structure design: months
- Coalition building: years
- Reproduction design: ongoing
- Founding act: moment, but prepared by all prior phases
- Maturation: decades

Hamilton's founding vision (1790s) was fully realized by Lincoln (1860s). Plan accordingly.

## Relation to Other Frameworks

| Framework | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Institutionalization Elements** | Domain lens for seeing institutions; this method *builds* what that framework *diagnoses* |
| **Oikonomia vs Chrematistics** | Provides the telos distinction; institutions should be oikonomic (bounded purpose) not chrematistic (unbounded accumulation) |
| **Recon Method** | Precedes founding; use Recon to understand the domain before founding within it |
| **Etymon Method** | Informs founding; excavation of "institution" recovered the sense of "causing to stand" |

---

## Historical Examples

### Hamilton Founding the American System (1790s)

| Phase | Hamilton's Work |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Vision** | National productive capacity; independence from Britain |
| **Theory** | Report on Manufactures (1791) — infant industry argument, objections addressed |
| **Structure** | First Bank of US, Treasury Department, tariff system |
| **Coalition** | Commercial interests, manufacturers, Federalists |
| **Reproduction** | Treasury bureaucracy; but weak (no dedicated training) |
| **Founding Act** | Bank charter (1791), tariffs enacted |

**Weakness:** Reproduction was weak. When coalition politics shifted (Jeffersonians, then Jacksonians), the institution couldn't maintain itself. Vision had to be re-founded by Clay and Lincoln.

### Contemporary Challenge: Post-Globalist Institutions

| Phase | Current Status |
|-------|----------------|
| **Vision** | Emerging (American Compass articulating) |
| **Theory** | Building (Listian/Hamiltonian recovery) |
| **Structure** | Nascent (state experimentation; CHIPS precedent) |
| **Coalition** | Forming (manufacturers, some labor, national conservatives) |
| **Reproduction** | Critical gap (where do developmentalists come from?) |
| **Founding Act** | Not yet |

**Implication:** Work is needed on all phases, but especially Reproduction. Without personnel pipeline, even good founding will fail.

## Summary

Institutional founding is not advocacy. It is the act of causing something to stand durably for a purpose.

| Phase | Question | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **1. Vision** | What is this for? | Telos, household, absence, limit |
| **2. Theory** | Why is this necessary? | Objections, responses, principles, precedents |
| **3. Structure** | How will it operate? | Jurisdiction, legal form, organization, procedures |
| **4. Coalition** | Who will defend it? | Interests, allies, leadership, organization |
| **5. Reproduction** | How will it perpetuate? | Personnel, training, culture, adaptation |
| **6. Founding Act** | Execute | Resources, personnel, legal formation, operations, survival |

The American System succeeded because Hamilton, Clay, and Lincoln worked through these phases. The globalist arrangement is vulnerable because its elements are under simultaneous stress. What replaces it will survive only if founders build all six phases intentionally.

**The method recovers the original sense of "institution":** not a thing that exists, but the act of causing something to stand.
