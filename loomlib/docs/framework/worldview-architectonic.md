# Worldview Architectonic

**The structure of structures — the framework that organizes all other frameworks.**

## Purpose

A worldview is not a set of opinions. It is the substrate from which all decisions emerge. The statesman who lacks explicit worldview still operates from implicit commitments — he simply cannot examine or transmit them.

This framework provides the ten categories that constitute a complete worldview. For each category, one must articulate a position — not tentatively, but as commitment. Revision is permitted later, but one cannot build on "I'm not sure."

---

## The Ten Categories

### I. Metaphysics: What Is Real?

**The question:** What is the fundamental structure of reality?

**Positions to navigate:**
- **Materialism:** Only matter exists. Mind is epiphenomenon. No transcendence.
- **Idealism:** Mind or spirit is fundamental. Matter is derivative or illusory.
- **Dualism:** Mind and matter are distinct substances.
- **Christian metaphysics:** Creation is real but dependent. God is Being itself. The material world is good but not ultimate.
- **Traditionalist metaphysics:** Multiple levels of reality — material, psychic, spiritual. Higher levels are more real. The modern world has collapsed into the lowest level.

**The commitment requires:** Is reality hierarchical (Traditionalist/Neoplatonic) or sacramental (Christian — matter infused with spirit, not inferior to it)? Is the material world a prison, a school, or a gift? What is the relationship between the visible and the invisible?

---

### II. Theology: Who Is God?

**The question:** What is the nature of the divine, and what is God's relationship to the world?

**Positions to navigate:**
- **Deism:** God created but does not intervene. Providence is general, not specific.
- **Theism:** God is personal, active, intervening. Providence is specific.
- **Pantheism:** God is identical with the world. No transcendence.
- **Panentheism:** God contains the world but exceeds it. The world is in God.
- **Trinitarian Christianity:** God is three persons, one substance. The Son became incarnate. The Spirit proceeds and indwells.
- **Perennialism:** The divine is one reality expressed through multiple traditions. No single tradition has exclusive access.

**The commitment requires:** Is Christ unique (the only Incarnation) or exemplary (one avatar among many)? Is salvation through Christ alone, or are there other paths? What is the relationship between Christianity and other traditions — preparations, corruptions, or parallel expressions?

---

### III. Anthropology: What Is Man?

**The question:** What is human nature? What are humans for?

**Positions to navigate:**
- **Liberal anthropology:** Man is a rights-bearing individual. Autonomy is the highest value. Human nature is plastic, self-constructed.
- **Marxist anthropology:** Man is a species-being defined by productive relations. Human nature is historically constructed.
- **Darwinian anthropology:** Man is an evolved animal. Human nature is the product of selection pressures.
- **Christian anthropology:** Man is created in God's image, fallen, redeemable. Human nature is fixed but damaged. The telos is theosis — becoming like God through grace.
- **Traditionalist anthropology:** Man has a caste-nature (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra). Human types are qualitatively different. Hierarchy is natural and just.

**The commitment requires:** Is the archetypal framework (King, Warrior, Magician, Lover) descriptive (useful model) or ontological (real structures of being)? What is man's telos — what are we for?

---

### IV. Epistemology: How Do We Know?

**The question:** What counts as knowledge? How do we access truth?

**Positions to navigate:**
- **Rationalism:** Knowledge comes through reason. What can be demonstrated logically is known.
- **Empiricism:** Knowledge comes through observation. What can be measured and tested is known.
- **Pragmatism:** Knowledge is what works. Truth is what produces successful action.
- **Revelation:** Some truths are given, not discovered. Scripture, tradition, encounter communicate what reason cannot reach.
- **Participatory knowing:** Knowledge requires participation, not just observation. You know by becoming, not just by examining.
- **Initiatic knowledge:** Some truths are accessible only through transformation. You must be changed to perceive them.

**The commitment requires:** How do these modes relate? Is participatory knowing superior to propositional, or merely different? What is the authority structure — when reason and revelation conflict, which wins? What validates initiatic knowledge — how do you distinguish genuine gnosis from delusion?

---

### V. Ethics: What Is Good?

**The question:** What ought we do? What makes actions right or wrong?

**Positions to navigate:**
- **Deontology:** Actions are right or wrong in themselves, regardless of consequences. Duty is primary.
- **Consequentialism:** Actions are right or wrong based on outcomes. Results are primary.
- **Virtue ethics:** Actions flow from character. The question is not "what should I do?" but "what kind of person should I be?"
- **Divine command:** Good is what God commands. There is no independent standard.
- **Natural law:** Good is what accords with human nature rightly understood. Reason can discern it.
- **Ilyin's position:** Action in a fallen world always involves sin. The statesman bears his sin, confesses, and trusts grace. Inaction is also sin.

**The commitment requires:** How do you adjudicate specific cases? What are your red lines — sins you will not bear even for good ends? How do you distinguish "bearing sin" from "rationalizing evil"?

---

### VI. Political Philosophy: What Is Legitimate Order?

**The question:** What is the nature of political authority? What makes it legitimate?

**Positions to navigate:**
- **Liberal contractarianism:** Authority derives from consent. Legitimacy is procedural.
- **Classical republicanism:** Authority serves the common good. Legitimacy is substantive.
- **Monarchism:** Authority descends from God through the sovereign. Legitimacy is sacramental.
- **Nationalism:** The nation is the natural political unit. Authority is legitimate when it serves the nation.
- **Integralism:** The state should be ordered toward the true religion. The church has indirect authority over temporal matters.
- **Schmittian realism:** Sovereignty is the capacity to decide the exception. Legitimacy is effective order, not consent.

**The commitment requires:** Where does authority come from — not where should it go, but where does it originate? If not consent, what? If God, through what mediation?

---

### VII. Economics: What Is Wealth For?

**The question:** What is the purpose of economic activity? What is the right relationship between economy and polity?

**Positions to navigate:**
- **Liberal economics:** The market is a spontaneous order. Efficiency is the goal. Government should minimize intervention.
- **Marxist economics:** Capital exploits labor. The market is ideological cover for domination. The goal is collective ownership.
- **Listian economics:** Productive capacity is the goal, not exchange efficiency. The state must develop national industry against foreign competition.
- **Distributism:** Widespread ownership is the goal. Both capitalism and socialism concentrate power. The state should favor small property.
- **Oikonomia:** The household is the model. Economy serves the flourishing of households, not the accumulation of abstract wealth.

**The commitment requires:** How do you handle the tension between List (national-scale industrial policy) and Distributism (small-scale ownership)? At what scale should enterprise operate? What is the role of the state versus private action?

---

### VIII. Philosophy of History: What Is the Shape of Time?

**The question:** Is there a pattern to history? Progress? Decline? Cycles?

**Positions to navigate:**
- **Progressive:** History moves toward improvement. The arc bends toward justice.
- **Cyclical:** History repeats. Cultures rise and fall in predictable patterns. (Spengler, Vico)
- **Decline:** We are in a falling age. Tradition degrades. The Kali Yuga. (Guénon, Evola)
- **Christian eschatology:** History moves toward consummation. Christ will return. The Kingdom will come. But the path is not smooth — it includes tribulation.
- **Providential:** God governs history. Events have meaning. But the meaning is not always visible.

**The commitment requires:** Are we in the Kali Yuga? If so, what does Christian hope mean within civilizational decline? Is building futile — just slowing the inevitable — or does Christian eschatology break the cycle?

---

### IX. Eschatology: What Is the End?

**The question:** What is the final state? What happens after death, after history?

**Positions to navigate:**
- **Materialist:** Death is the end. There is no beyond.
- **Reincarnation:** The soul returns in new bodies until liberation.
- **Christian:** Resurrection of the body. Judgment. Heaven and hell. New creation.
- **Traditionalist:** Return to the Source. The cycle completes. Individual extinction in the Absolute.

**The commitment requires:** What do you actually believe happens after death? What is heaven? What is hell? Are they states, places, both? What is the resurrection of the body — continuity of this body, or something else? What is the new creation — restoration of Eden, or something genuinely new?

---

### X. Ecclesiology: Where Is the Church?

**The question:** What is the church, and where is it concretely located?

This integrates everything else. Your metaphysics, theology, anthropology, epistemology — all bear on where you worship and why.

**The commitment requires:** Not "Orthodoxy is interesting" but "We will attend _____ parish and submit to _____ bishop." Ecclesiology admits no refinement — only decision.

## Protocol: Articulating a Position

For each category:

### 1. Identify Current State

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Articulated** | Position exists but scattered | Consolidate into one paragraph |
| **Strong with tension** | Position clear but unresolved questions | Resolve the tension explicitly |
| **Engaged but not committed** | Exploring, not yet owned | Move from "exploring" to "believing" |
| **Implicit** | Position held but not articulated | Make explicit |
| **Unresolved** | No clear position | Investigate, then commit |

### 2. Write the Commitment

One paragraph minimum, one page maximum. Clear enough that someone else could read it and know what you believe.

**Format:**
```
I believe [POSITION]. This means [IMPLICATIONS].
I hold this because [GROUNDS — experience, revelation, reasoning].
The tensions I carry: [UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS, if any].
This commits me to: [DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS for action].
```

### 3. Distinguish Theory from Conviction

- **Theory:** Interesting, defensible, might change with new argument
- **Conviction:** Owned, operative, survives opposition

The goal is conviction, not theory. Conviction survives opposition. Theory crumbles.

### 4. Identify Downstream

Each commitment has implications:
- Metaphysics → shapes what counts as evidence
- Theology → shapes what authority you recognize
- Anthropology → shapes how you raise children, manage people
- Epistemology → shapes what you trust
- Ethics → shapes what you do
- Political Philosophy → shapes civic engagement
- Economics → shapes business decisions
- Philosophy of History → shapes strategic time horizon
- Eschatology → shapes what you hope for
- Ecclesiology → shapes Sunday morning

## The Output: A Credo

Ten categories. Ten commitments. Clear enough to hand to your children.

This is the Bedford Confession — the substrate from which all strategy, operations, and action emerge. Without this foundation, everything else is ad hoc.

---

## Integration with Loomlib

- Each category becomes an instance document: `inst-credo-{category}`
- All ten are collected in `idx-bedford-credo`
- The credo informs `idx-user-commitments` — resolving its unresolved questions
- Frameworks like `fw-four-knowings`, `fw-oikonomia-chrematistics` feed specific categories
- Sources provide upstream evidence for positions

## Warning: The Magician Trap

Framework creation is Magician work. The danger: elaborate architecture that never produces conviction.

**The test:** By sabbatical's end, can you state each position instantly if asked? Not "I'm exploring..." but "I believe X."

Conviction is the deliverable, not documentation.
