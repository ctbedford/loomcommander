# Oikonomia vs Chrematistics

**Type:** Domain Framework
**Perspective:** Economic Genealogy
**Source:** Aristotle, Politics Book I

## The Distinction

Aristotle saw two orientations toward wealth:

| Oikonomia | Chrematistics |
|-----------|---------------|
| Household management | Wealth-getting |
| Bounded by need | Unbounded accumulation |
| Wealth as means | Wealth as end |
| Natural | Unnatural |
| Has a telos | Telos-less |
| Knows when to stop | Cannot stop |

The Greek *oikos* (household) + *nomos* (law/management) = the law of the household. Economics was originally about managing a bounded domain toward flourishing.

Chrematistics (*chrema* = wealth, possession) is the art of acquisition itself. When acquisition becomes its own end, there is no limit principle. You cannot have "enough" because there is no "for what."

## The Diagnostic Questions

When examining any economic arrangement:

1. **Where are the limits?** What constrains accumulation? If nothing — chrematistic.
2. **What is the telos?** Accumulation for what? If "more" — chrematistic.
3. **Who is the household?** Whose flourishing does this serve? If no one's — chrematistic.
4. **What counts as enough?** Is there a satiation point? If not — chrematistic.

## The Drift

Modern "economics" lost the oikonomia root entirely. The discipline became the study of unlimited wants meeting scarce means — chrematistics by definition. The question "what is wealth for?" became unanswerable within the frame.

The household disappeared. The corporation has no oikos — no bounded community whose flourishing it serves. Growth became the only metric because there is no telos against which to measure sufficiency.

## Recovery Patterns

What would oikonomic arrangements look like today?

- **Businesses with sufficiency targets** — "We want to reach X revenue and stay there"
- **Steward ownership** — Purpose lock, profit cap, non-extractive
- **Cooperative structures** — The enterprise serves members, not capital
- **Place-based enterprise** — Bounded by geography, accountable to community
- **Family business succession** — Intergenerational time horizon changes what "growth" means

## Deployment

When analyzing an enterprise, investment, or economic policy:
1. Apply the four diagnostic questions
2. Trace what happens as scale increases — does the arrangement stay oikonomic or drift chrematistic?
3. Identify who the implicit "household" is (or notice its absence)
4. Ask what "enough" would look like — if the question is unanswerable, you've found the problem
