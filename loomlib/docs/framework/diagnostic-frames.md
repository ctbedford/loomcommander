# Diagnostic Frames

**Type:** Toolkit Framework
**Function:** Multi-axis analysis for locating position and movement

## The Frames

### By Capacity
What can you do with it?

| Capacity | Question |
|----------|----------|
| Diagnosis | Can you identify what's happening? |
| Articulation | Can you say what's happening? |
| Reading | Can you interpret what others have made? |
| Structuring | Can you organize material into form? |
| Inhabiting | Can you live inside the framework? |

### By Acquisition
How do you get it?

| Mode | Method |
|------|--------|
| Study | Encounter texts, absorb propositional content |
| Practice | Repeated exercise, build procedural capacity |
| Production | Make things, develop through output |

### By Aspect
What dimension are you working in?

| Aspect | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Meaning | What does it signify? |
| Structure | How is it organized? |
| Substance | What is it made of? |
| Relation | How does it connect? |

### By Granularity
What level of abstraction?

| Level | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| Meta | About the system itself |
| Domain | A field of practice |
| Instrument | A specific tool |
| Instance | A particular case |

### By Knowing Type
Which of the four knowings?

| Type | Character |
|------|-----------|
| Propositional | That — facts, information |
| Procedural | How — skills, capacities |
| Perspectival | What — salience, attention |
| Participatory | Who — identity, mutual recognition |

## The Diagnostic Pattern

Upper-left strong: conceptual, meaning, meta, propositional
Lower-right weak: material, substance, instance, participatory

Curriculum builds upper-right. Practice builds lower half.

## Deployment

When diagnosing a project, skill, or situation:
1. Run it through multiple frames
2. Note where it clusters
3. Identify what's missing
4. The gap is the work
