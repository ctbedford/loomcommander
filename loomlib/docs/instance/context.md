# CONTEXT

**Type:** Instance
**Frameworks:** Etymon Method, Context as Weaving
**Output:** Etymon
**Status:** Verified

## CONTEXT AS Weaving

The operator: **AS** — recovers original sense

---

## Excavation

Latin *contextus* — a joining together, connection. Past participle of *contexere*: to weave together.

*Con-* (together) + *texere* (to weave).

The same root gives us *text* and *textile*. A text was woven. Context was the weaving-together that produced it. Context is not a space that holds things — it's the **act of interweaving**.

---

## Drift

**Weaving → Surrounding → Container → "Background"**

1. **Weaving together:** Active creation of relational structure
2. **What surrounds:** The circumstances around a thing
3. **Container:** The box you put information in
4. **Background:** Stuff you mention before the real content

Modern usage: "Let me give you some context" = "Here is information that precedes what I actually want to say."

The "context window" metaphor completes the drift: context as container with size limits. Fill it or don't. The question becomes quantitative. This loses the relational logic entirely.

---

## What the Drift Costs

Each element added creates relational possibilities with every other element. You're not filling a bucket. You're adding threads to a loom. The wrong thread doesn't just take up space — it tangles the entire weave.

If context is a container:
- More information is always better
- Order doesn't matter
- Context is separate from content
- Anyone can provide context

If context is weaving:
- Quality of relation matters more than quantity
- Order of introduction shapes what patterns emerge
- Context *is* the structure that makes content meaningful
- Weaving is a skill

---

## ATTENTION: Stretching Toward

The transformer architecture uses "attention mechanisms." Etymology: Latin *attendere*, "to stretch toward" (*ad-* to + *tendere* to stretch).

Transformers "overallocate attention to irrelevant context." This is the failure of **discriminate attention** — stretching toward everything present rather than toward what matters.

If you put twenty things in context, the model stretches toward all twenty. Chekhov's gun: the model assumes everything present must be used.

Minimal CLAUDE.md files outperform bloated ones. Not because of token limits — because of attention distribution.

---

## Recovery

Context-as-weaving recovers:

1. **Relational thinking:** The question isn't "does this fit?" but "what relations does this introduce?"

2. **Pruning as essential craft:** If context is weaving, pruning is *part of the making* — deciding which threads don't belong in this fabric.

3. **The 20-turn cliff as pattern collapse:** Where the weave becomes too dense. Too many threads crossing too many other threads. The fabric can no longer hold a coherent pattern. It's not token exhaustion — it's relational overload.

---

## The Production Model

**Context is the loom. The artifact is the fabric.**

You don't "give context." You weave it. The quality of what can be made depends on the quality of the weave.

---

## The Compression

**CONTEXT:** From weaving-together to container. The active creation of relational structure became passive information storage. Recovery means remembering that context isn't background — it's the loom that makes the pattern possible.
