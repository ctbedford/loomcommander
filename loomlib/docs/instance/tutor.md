## TUTOR AS Guardian

The operator: **AS** — recovers original sense

## Excavation

Latin *tutor* — guardian, protector, defender. From *tueri* — to watch, guard, protect.

The tutor was not an instructor. The tutor was the one who *watched over*. In Roman law, a *tutor* was appointed to protect the interests of those who couldn't protect themselves — orphans, the young, those not yet capable of managing their own affairs.

The relationship was fiduciary. The tutor's job was to guard the ward's interests until they could guard their own. Success meant the tutor was no longer needed.

## Drift

**Tutor → Instructor → Content Deliverer**

The guardian became a teacher. The teacher became a content delivery mechanism. The fiduciary relationship disappeared entirely.

Modern "tutoring" means supplementary instruction — someone who helps you pass tests. The tutoring industry sells hours of explanation. No one asks: tutoring *toward what*? When is the student ready to not need a tutor?

The drift follows a pattern:
1. **Guardian** — watches over development toward independence
2. **Teacher** — transmits knowledge and skill
3. **Instructor** — delivers curriculum
4. **Tutor** — helps with homework

Each step loses something. The guardian's job was to *end the relationship well*. The modern tutor's job is to maintain billable hours.

## Recovery

What would tutoring-as-guardianship look like?

- **Developmental telos:** The tutor's success is measured by the student's independence, not continued dependence
- **Fiduciary structure:** The tutor's interests legally bound to the student's interests
- **Watch over, not talk at:** Attention to the whole person, not just the subject matter
- **Protection function:** Guarding the student from premature exposure, bad influences, exploitation
- **Exit criteria:** Clear markers for when guardianship ends

The question for any educational relationship: Is this structured to end well, or to perpetuate itself?

## The Compression

**TUTOR:** From guardian of development to vendor of explanation. The one who watches over became the one who talks at. Recovery means restoring the fiduciary structure — the tutor succeeds when they're no longer needed.
