# HIERARCHICAL SPECTATORSHIP

**Type:** Instance
**Frameworks:** Etymon Method, Agonal Identity
**Output:** Etymon
**Status:** Incubating

## Spectatorship WITHIN Hierarchy

The operator: **WITHIN** — situates in structure

## Excavation

*Spectator:* Latin *spectare* — to watch, to observe. One who watches.

*Hierarchy:* Greek *hieros* (sacred) + *arkhein* (to rule). Sacred rule, ordered ranks.

*Hierarchical spectatorship:* The phenomenon where watching itself is ranked. Not just who acts, but who gets to watch — and whose watching matters.

## The Shonen Pattern

Dragon Ball Z as case study:

Fights happen. But most characters don't fight — they watch. And the watchers are ranked:

1. **The fighters:** Goku, Vegeta — participants
2. **First-tier spectators:** Strong warriors who could fight but don't (Piccolo, Gohan) — their reactions validate power levels
3. **Second-tier spectators:** Weaker Z-fighters — their astonishment marks escalation
4. **Third-tier spectators:** Normal humans — total incomprehension, register only destruction
5. **Absent spectators:** Those too far away to perceive anything

The hierarchy of spectatorship *is* the power scaling system. Your ability to perceive the fight indicates your rank. When Krillin can no longer follow the action, you know the fighters have ascended.

## The Structure

| Spectator Tier | Can Perceive | Reaction | Function |
|---------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Top fighters | Everything | Engage | Participate |
| Elite spectators | Most | Analyze | Validate |
| Mid-tier spectators | Some | Astonished | Mark escalation |
| Weak spectators | Little | Overwhelmed | Register power |
| Absent | Nothing | None | Show transcendence |

## The Agonal Connection

In Greek agon, spectators mattered. The audience's recognition made victory real. Excellence required witnesses.

Shonen manga literalizes this:
- Power is meaningless without spectators who can perceive it
- Higher power requires higher-tier spectators
- The ultimate power might have *no* adequate spectators

The question: If no one can perceive your power, are you powerful? DBZ's answer is ambivalent. Beerus's power is real, but partly illegible until someone can register it.

## Recovery

The concept excavates:
- **How communities validate excellence:** Whose perception counts?
- **Spectatorship as participation:** Watching is not passive; it constitutes the event
- **Ranked perception:** Some can see what others can't
- **The problem of transcendence:** What happens when you exceed all spectators?

## The Compression

**HIERARCHICAL SPECTATORSHIP:** In Dragon Ball Z, watching is ranked. Your ability to perceive the fight marks your own power level. The spectator hierarchy *is* the power scaling system. This excavates how communities validate excellence — whose perception constitutes recognition.
