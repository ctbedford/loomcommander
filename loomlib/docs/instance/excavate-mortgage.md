# Excavation: MORTGAGE

**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** research (pre-production)

---

### Etymology

**Root:** Old French *mort gage* — literally "death pledge"
**Components:** *mort* (dead, from Latin *mortuus*) + *gage* (pledge, from Frankish *wadi*)
**First attested:** Late 14th century in English; 13th century in French
**Medieval Latin:** *mortuum wadium* (dead pledge)

**Sources consulted:**
- [Etymonline - Mortgage](https://www.etymonline.com/word/mortgage)
- [Wiktionary - Mortgage](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mortgage)
- [Wordfoolery - The Deadly History of Mortgage](https://wordfoolery.wordpress.com/2022/12/20/the-deadly-history-of-mortgage/)

**Findings:**

The etymology is stark: **mortgage means death pledge**.

Sir Edward Coke's 17th-century explanation (from *Coke upon Littleton*, 1664): The deal is called "dead" because it must die — either by the debt being paid, or by the property being seized. One way or another, the arrangement terminates.

Two possible deaths:
1. **The debt dies** — you pay, the pledge is released, the mortgage ends
2. **The property dies to you** — you fail, the property is forfeit, gone forever

The word contains its own end. Every mortgage carries death inside it.

The -t- in *mort* is silent in English pronunciation because of the French origin — we kept the spelling but lost the sound. Yet "mort" connects to: mortal, mortality, mortuary, mortify, mortician. The death family.

Related: *amortization* — "killing" the debt gradually. Each payment is a small death.

### Semantic History

**Key inflection points:**

1. **Medieval period:** Mortgages were rare, associated with distress. Pawning land was shameful — you pledged your inheritance.

2. **Early modern:** Property becomes more liquid. Mortgages enable land transactions without losing face entirely — the pledge is "dead" not because shameful, but because temporary.

3. **19th-20th century:** Mortgage becomes normal. Homeownership ideology makes 30-year death pledges virtuous.

4. **2008 and after:** Mortgage becomes "product." Bundled, securitized, traded. The death pledge becomes a financial instrument nobody reads.

**Sources:**
- Legal history of property (Coke, Blackstone)
- History of homeownership ideology (post-WWII America)

### Contemporary Usage

**Dominant meaning:** A loan secured by real property; the standard way to buy a house

**What's lost:**
- The death structure (something must die)
- The pledge (your word, your commitment)
- The stakes (property forfeit means social death)

**What's distorted:**
- "Getting a mortgage" sounds like receiving something, not giving a death pledge
- "Mortgage payment" hides that you're killing a debt
- "Underwater mortgage" — the metaphor shifts to drowning, losing the death frame

---

### Recovery Hypothesis

**Claim:** Mortgage should be heard as death pledge — an arrangement where you gamble your dwelling against your ability to pay, where failure means losing the shelter.

**Application:**
- When someone says "I got a mortgage," hear: "I gave a death pledge on my home"
- When banks speak of "mortgage products," hear: "death pledge instruments"
- When policy encourages "homeownership through mortgages," hear: "ownership through death pledges"

**Stakes:**

The domestication of "mortgage" normalizes enormous risk. A 30-year death pledge on the place you live is not a "product" — it's a commitment of your shelter against your future income for three decades.

Recovering the death-pledge would add friction: are you ready to make a death pledge? Is this property worth pledging your future on? The word would resist being spoken casually.

### Production Readiness

**Ready for instance?** Yes — etymology is dramatic, drift is clear, recovery is provocative

**Suggested operator:** **AS** — MORTGAGE AS Death Pledge (recovering the hidden identity)

Alternative: **FROM** — MORTGAGE FROM Death (tracing the origin)

**Suggested formula:** Etymon Method + Oikonomia/Chrematistics (death pledge is oikonomic — it has an end; mortgage-as-product is chrematistic — it compounds)

---

### Notes for Production

The hook: "Mortgage comes from Old French *mort gage* — death pledge. Every time you make a payment, you're killing a little bit of your debt. And if you stop paying, your home dies to you forever."

The structure:
1. The French etymology (*mort gage*)
2. Coke's explanation (the deal must die)
3. The two deaths (debt dies or property dies)
4. How we stopped hearing it (product, instrument)
5. Recovery: what if we called it what it is?

Visual possibility: Medieval deed of mortgage, or foreclosure notice juxtaposed with "product" language.

Connection to CAPITAL: cattle die, capital doesn't — but mortgages remember death.
