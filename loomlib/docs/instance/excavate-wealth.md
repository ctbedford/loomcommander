# Excavation: WEALTH

**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** research (pre-production)

### Etymology

**Root:** Old English *wela* (well-being, prosperity) → Middle English *welth/welthe* (happiness, prosperity)
**Proto-Germanic:** *walô* (well-being, prosperity)
**Proto-Indo-European:** *wel-* (to wish, to will; source of "well" and "will")
**Cognates:** German *Wohl* (well-being), Danish *vel*, Swedish *väl*

**Sources consulted:**
- [Etymonline - Wealth](https://www.etymonline.com/word/wealth)
- [Etymonline - Weal](https://www.etymonline.com/word/weal)
- [Wiktionary - Wealth](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wealth)
- [The Earthbound Report - Etymology of Wealth](https://earthbound.report/2012/03/14/an-etymology-of-wealth/)

**Findings:**

**Wealth meant well-being.** Not money. Not assets. Not net worth. Well-being.

The root is *wela* — the Old English word for "well-being." Same root as "well" (the adverb) and "will" (desire). Wealth was the state of being well.

*Weal* and *wealth* were once synonyms. Both meant prosperity AND well-being. "Commonwealth" preserves this — common weal, common well-being, not common riches.

The semantic narrowing:
- ~1250 AD: *welth* emerges
- ~1430 AD: settles around "riches and prosperity"
- By modernity: purely financial meaning dominates

What was lost: the wider meanings of health, happiness, flourishing. Wealth shrank from **how you are** to **what you have**.

The German preserves the older sense: *Wohlstand* (prosperity/wealth) literally means "well-standing" — the state of standing well. And *Wohlbefinden* (well-being) shares the root.

### Semantic History

**Key inflection points:**

1. **Old English:** *Wela* meant general prosperity, good fortune, flourishing. Closely connected to health and happiness.

2. **Middle English (~1250-1430):** *Welth* develops as a noun form. Still carries both meanings — riches AND well-being.

3. **Early Modern English:** Financial meaning dominates. "Wealth" increasingly means what you have, not how you are.

4. **Industrial/capitalist era:** Wealth becomes measurable, countable, comparable. Net worth. GDP. "Wealth creation" means making money, not making people well.

**The drift parallels oikonomia → chrematistics:**
- Oikonomia: wealth as flourishing within a household
- Chrematistics: wealth as accumulation without bound

When wealth meant well-being, you could have enough. When wealth means assets, there's no enough.

### Contemporary Usage

**Dominant meaning:** Financial assets, net worth, economic resources

**What's lost:**
- Well-being (health, happiness, flourishing)
- The qualitative dimension (how you are, not just what you have)
- The connection to "well" (being well, doing well)

**What's distorted:**
- "Wealth creation" sounds like making good, but means making money
- "Wealthy" describes bank account, not life quality
- "Wealth management" manages assets, not well-being

**Traces of the old meaning:**
- "Health is wealth" — a cliché that remembers the connection
- "Commonwealth" — common well-being
- "Weal and woe" — flourishing and suffering (archaic)

### Recovery Hypothesis

**Claim:** Wealth should mean well-being — the state of being well, flourishing, having enough for life to go well.

**Application:**
- When measuring "national wealth," ask: are people well?
- When someone is called "wealthy," ask: are they flourishing?
- When policy aims at "wealth creation," ask: is it creating well-being?

**Stakes:**

The reduction of wealth to assets enables chrematistics. If wealth is only money, more is always better. If wealth is well-being, there's a satiation point — you can have enough well-being.

Recovering wealth-as-wellbeing would transform:
- Economics: not just GDP, but flourishing metrics
- Personal finance: not just net worth, but life quality
- Policy: not just growth, but genuine prosperity

This is the direct oikonomic recovery: the household has enough when its members are well.

### Production Readiness

**Ready for instance?** Yes — etymology is powerful, drift is clear, recovery has stakes

**Suggested operator:** **AS** — WEALTH AS Well-Being (recovering the hidden identity)

Alternative: **WITHOUT** — WEALTH WITHOUT Well-Being (naming what's lost)

**Suggested formula:** Etymon Method + Oikonomia/Chrematistics (this is the core oikonomic concept)

### Notes for Production

The hook: "Wealth comes from the Old English word for well-being. *Wela* — to be well. Somewhere between the Anglo-Saxons and the Forbes list, we forgot that wealth meant flourishing, not fortune."

The structure:
1. The etymology (*wela* = well-being)
2. The connection to "well" and "will"
3. When it narrowed (1250-1430)
4. What was lost (you can't have "enough" assets, but you can have enough well-being)
5. Recovery: what if wealth meant wellness again?

Visual possibility: "Commonwealth" — the common weal, the common well-being. Etymology chart showing wealth/weal/well from same root.

Connection to oikonomia: This IS the oikonomic concept. Bounded by enough. Aimed at flourishing. Wealth-as-wela is what chrematistics destroyed.

This may be the most important excavation for the economic genealogy series — it's the positive concept that chrematistics displaced.
