# Credo II: Theology — Who Is God?

**The Question:** What is the nature of the divine, and what is God's relationship to the world?

**Status:** ◐ Strong, with tension
**Action Required:** Resolve Christ's uniqueness

---

## The Commitment (PARTIALLY ARTICULATED)

What is already owned:

> I confess that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior. I submitted to this after encounter, not argument. The Incarnation is real — God became man in history. This is not myth in the dismissive sense but myth in the true sense: the story that actually happened.

What remains unresolved:

> Is Christ unique (the only Incarnation) or exemplary (one avatar among many)? Is salvation through Christ alone, or are there other paths? What is the relationship between Christianity and other traditions?

---

## The Encounter

The theological position did not arise from argument. It arose from encounter.

From your own account:

> "After my first experience with LSD I recognized I believed in an ontological evil, and thus I figured there must be an ontological opposite to evil to counter it and I felt as if in my material physical reality and life that must be Jesus Christ... so I felt the power and the moment that I was living through must mean I have to be on the side of good and submit that Christ is my Lord and savior."

**What this establishes:**
1. **Ontological evil is real** — You experienced it, not inferred it
2. **Ontological good is real** — Deduced from the reality of evil
3. **Christ is the embodiment of ontological good** — In your material reality and life
4. **Submission was required** — Not just acknowledgment, but submission
5. **This was encounter, not argument** — Participatory knowing, not propositional

## The Strong Positions

### Trinitarian Theism

| Position | Status | Grounds |
|----------|--------|---------|
| God is personal | Held | Encounter was personal, not abstract |
| God intervenes | Held | The encounter was intervention |
| Providence is specific | Held | Your life was addressed, not humanity in general |
| Trinity | Held (implicit) | From Orthodox/Catholic investigation |
| Incarnation is real | Held | "God became man in history" |

### The Incarnation

You believe:
- The Word became flesh (John 1:14)
- This happened in history, at a specific time and place
- Jesus of Nazareth was not merely a teacher or prophet but God incarnate
- The crucifixion was real, the resurrection was real
- These events are the hinge of history

### Grace and Works

From your engagement with Orthodoxy and Ilyin:
- Grace is primary — we cannot earn salvation
- But grace is not passive — it empowers action
- Synergy (Orthodox): human will cooperates with divine grace
- Ilyin: the statesman bears sin in acting, trusts grace, confesses

---

## The Tension: Christ's Uniqueness

This is the unresolved question that determines everything downstream.

### The Options

#### Option A: Christ is Unique (Exclusivism)

**The Position:**
- The Incarnation is the only incarnation
- There is no other name under heaven by which we must be saved (Acts 4:12)
- Other religions are preparations (at best) or corruptions (at worst)
- Salvation is through Christ alone

**Implications:**
- Other traditions have partial truths but not saving truth
- Evangelism is obligatory — people need to hear the Gospel
- The Traditionalist perennialism is wrong
- Guénon, Evola, Schuon are useful diagnosticians but wrong about the fundamental question

#### Option B: Christ is Exemplary (Perennialism)

**The Position:**
- The Incarnation is one expression of the divine entering matter
- Other traditions have their own avatars, incarnations, manifestations
- All genuine traditions access the same transcendent reality
- Salvation (liberation, enlightenment, theosis) has multiple valid paths

**Implications:**
- Christianity is *your* path, not *the* path
- Other traditions are parallel, not inferior
- Guénon was right: the Primordial Tradition underlies all authentic religions
- Evangelism is inappropriate — each tradition is valid for its adherents

#### Option C: Christ is Unique but Other Traditions Prepare (Inclusivism)

**The Position:**
- Christ is the unique Incarnation and only Savior
- But God's grace works through other traditions to prepare people for Christ
- Those who never hear the Gospel may be saved by Christ through implicit faith
- Other religions contain "seeds of the Word" (logos spermatikos)

**Implications:**
- Christianity fulfills what other traditions glimpse
- Evangelism is still important, but not the only means of salvation
- Guénon and Evola saw something real, but misidentified its source
- The Traditionalist insight (decline from primordial wisdom) is compatible with Christianity

---

## The Traditionalist Temptation

You engage Guénon and Evola seriously. They are not casual reading — they are "live options."

**What they offer:**
- Critique of modernity that cuts deeper than political analysis
- Framework for understanding decline (Kali Yuga)
- Hierarchy as metaphysically grounded, not arbitrary
- Initiatic knowledge and transformation
- Recovery of what the Enlightenment destroyed

**The problem:**
- Guénon's perennialism denies Christ's uniqueness
- Evola's paganism rejects Christianity altogether (or reduces it to one tradition among many)
- If they're right about the Primordial Tradition, Christianity is not the final word
- If Christ is unique, their metaphysics is wrong at the foundation

**The question you carry:**
> Are Guénon and Evola right about decline, hierarchy, and tradition, but wrong about Christ? Or does their insight require their metaphysics?

---

## What Would Resolve This?

### Arguments for Christ's Uniqueness

1. **Historical particularity** — The Incarnation claims to be a singular event in history, not a recurring pattern
2. **Resurrection** — No other tradition claims a bodily resurrection verified by witnesses
3. **The Church's witness** — Two thousand years of martyrs died confessing Christ, not the Primordial Tradition
4. **Your encounter** — You didn't encounter "the Absolute" — you encountered Christ

### Arguments Against Pure Exclusivism

1. **The fate of the unevangelized** — Did everyone before Christ, and everyone who never heard, go to hell?
2. **Genuine holiness in other traditions** — Are Buddhist monks deceived? Are Hindu saints damned?
3. **The Traditionalist insight** — They see something real about decline and modernity. Is it all wrong?
4. **The dual face** — You encountered both the luminous and tenebrous face. Is evil equally real? What does that imply?

### The Orthodox Answer

Orthodoxy may offer a resolution:
- **Christ is unique** — The only Incarnation, the only Savior
- **But God's providence extends beyond the visible Church** — The Holy Spirit works where we do not see
- **Theosis is the goal** — And preparation for theosis may occur in other traditions
- **We do not judge the fate of others** — We confess Christ; we do not damn the unevangelized

This is neither pure exclusivism nor perennialism. It holds Christ's uniqueness while allowing mystery about how God saves.

---

## The Confession Required

To move from ◐ (strong with tension) to ◉ (owned), you must state:

### On God's Nature

```
I believe in one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — three persons, one substance.
The Father is the source; the Son is eternally begotten; the Spirit eternally proceeds.
This is not metaphor but reality.
```

### On the Incarnation

```
I believe the Son became incarnate — the Word became flesh — in Jesus of Nazareth.
This was a singular event in history, not a recurring pattern.
Christ is the unique Incarnation, not one avatar among many.
```

### On the Atonement

```
I believe Christ died for the sins of the world — not as moral example only, but as real sacrifice.
[Specify: penal substitution? Christus Victor? Satisfaction? Ransom? Recapitulation?]
The cross accomplished something objective, not just subjective.
```

### On the Resurrection

```
I believe Christ rose bodily from the dead on the third day.
The tomb was empty. The disciples saw him. This is history, not myth.
The resurrection is the guarantee of our resurrection.
```

### On Other Traditions

```
I believe [Exclusivist/Inclusivist/Other position].
Other traditions are [preparations/corruptions/parallel paths/something else].
This means [implications for how I regard Guénon, Evola, non-Christian traditions].
```

## Downstream Implications

This determines:

| If Christ Unique | Then |
|------------------|------|
| Ecclesiology | The Church Christ founded matters supremely |
| Anthropology | Man's telos is theosis in Christ, not generic enlightenment |
| Eschatology | Christian eschatology (resurrection, judgment, new creation) is true |
| Ethics | Christ's commands have ultimate authority |
| Philosophy of History | History is salvation history, moving toward Christ's return |

| If Perennialism | Then |
|-----------------|------|
| Ecclesiology | Church is your path, not the path |
| Anthropology | Man's telos is return to the Absolute, by many routes |
| Eschatology | Cyclical return, not linear consummation |
| Ethics | Multiple valid ethical frameworks |
| Philosophy of History | Decline and renewal cycles, not salvation history |

---

## The Test

When this document moves from ◐ to ◉, it will contain:

> "I believe in one God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I believe the Son became incarnate uniquely in Jesus Christ. I believe [specific position on atonement]. I believe in the bodily resurrection. I believe other traditions are [specific position]. This commits me to [downstream implications]."

The tension must be resolved. Not by avoiding the question, but by committing to an answer.
