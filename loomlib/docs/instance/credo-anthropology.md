# Credo III: Anthropology — What Is Man?

**The Question:** What is human nature? What are humans for?

**Status:** ◐ Articulated
**Action Required:** Clarify archetype-theology relationship

---

## The Commitment (PARTIALLY ARTICULATED)

What is already held:

> Man has archetypal structure: King, Warrior, Magician, Lover. These are real structures of the psyche, not merely useful models. Man is fallen but redeemable — Christian anthropology. Human telos is integration — the "full mature masculine." Hierarchy is natural — some are fit to govern, some are not.

What remains to clarify:

> Is the archetypal framework descriptive (useful model) or ontological (real structures of being)? What is the relationship between Jungian psychology and Christian anthropology — are they compatible, or must one subordinate the other?

---

## The Strong Positions

### Archetypal Structure (KWML)

From extensive work:
- **King:** Ordering, blessing, providing, protecting. The sovereign function.
- **Warrior:** Discipline, action, boundary-keeping, sacrifice. The fighting function.
- **Magician:** Knowledge, transformation, initiation, power of insight. The knowing function.
- **Lover:** Connection, passion, embodiment, appreciation. The desiring function.

**Self-Diagnosis:**
- Magician dominant (90%)
- Warrior underdeveloped (core growth edge)
- King integrating
- Lover moderate

**The Imbalance:** Framework proliferation without shipping. Research without action. The Magician trap.

### Fallen but Redeemable

Christian anthropology:
- Man is created in God's image (Imago Dei)
- Man fell — the image is damaged, not destroyed
- Man can be redeemed — through Christ, by grace
- Human nature is fixed but damaged

This grounds:
- Recognition of sin without despair
- Possibility of transformation
- Need for grace, not just effort

### Human Telos is Theosis

The goal is not just forgiveness but transformation:
- Becoming like God (2 Peter 1:4 — "partakers of the divine nature")
- Orthodox emphasis on theosis/deification
- Integration of all faculties — not suppression but ordering
- The "full mature masculine" as natural-level goal; theosis as supernatural completion

### Hierarchy is Natural

| Source | Articulation |
|--------|--------------|
| Traditionalist | Caste-nature: some are Brahmin, some Shudra |
| Cavalier | Some are fit to govern by breeding and formation |
| Aristotelian | Natural slaves and natural masters (controversial) |
| Christian | Qualitative difference in calling, gifts, authority |

You affirm hierarchy without accepting rigid caste. The question is what grounds legitimate hierarchy.

## The Tension: Archetypes and Theology

### Are Archetypes Real?

**Option A: Archetypes are Useful Models**

- They describe patterns in human psychology
- They are heuristics, not ontological structures
- Jung was a psychologist, not a metaphysician
- The KWML framework is a tool, not a map of the soul

*Implication:* Archetypes can be discarded if a better model comes along. They don't conflict with theology because they're not making metaphysical claims.

**Option B: Archetypes are Ontological Structures**

- They are real features of the psyche
- The collective unconscious is real, not metaphorical
- Archetypes are discovered, not invented
- The KWML framework reveals true structure of masculine soul

*Implication:* Archetypes must be integrated with theology. They are part of creation — how God made man.

### Jungian Psychology and Christianity

**The Compatibility Question:**

| Jung | Christianity |
|------|--------------|
| Collective unconscious | ? (No equivalent doctrine) |
| Archetypes as autonomous | God as ultimate author of the soul |
| Individuation as goal | Theosis as goal |
| Shadow integration | Confession and transformation |
| Self (archetype) | Christ? Imago Dei? |

**Possible Positions:**

1. **Jung describes natural level; Christianity describes supernatural level**
   - Archetypes are how God made the psyche
   - Individuation is natural maturity; theosis is supernatural completion
   - No conflict — different levels

2. **Jung must be subordinated to Christianity**
   - Where Jung conflicts with doctrine, doctrine wins
   - The Self is not identical to God or Christ
   - Archetypes are filtered through Christian anthropology

3. **Jung offers insights Christianity has forgotten**
   - Christianity became too rationalist, lost contact with soul
   - Jung recovered experiential, imaginal dimension
   - Integration is needed, not subordination

---

## The Caste Question

Evola and the Traditionalists:
- Caste-nature is real: Brahmin (priests), Kshatriya (warriors), Vaishya (merchants), Shudra (workers)
- Human types are qualitatively different
- Hierarchy is metaphysically grounded
- Modernity's egalitarianism is against nature

**Do you affirm this?**

| Position | Implications |
|----------|--------------|
| Caste is real | Some people are naturally superior; hierarchy is metaphysical |
| Caste is useful metaphor | Describes differences without claiming ontological status |
| Caste is dangerous distortion | Confuses contingent hierarchy with natural order |

The Cavalier inheritance affirms hierarchy — but by breeding and formation, not by metaphysical caste. Is this distinction coherent?

## The Confession Required

To move from ◐ to ◉, you must state:

### On Human Nature

```
I believe man is created in God's image, fallen, and redeemable.
Human nature is [fixed/plastic/developmental].
The damage of the fall is [total/partial/affects what specifically].
```

### On Archetypes

```
I believe archetypes are [ontological structures/useful models/something else].
The KWML framework [reveals/describes/approximates] the structure of the masculine soul.
Jungian psychology relates to Christianity by [subordination/integration/parallel tracks].
```

### On Human Telos

```
I believe man is for [theosis/flourishing/return to source/other].
This means [specific implications for how life should be lived].
The full mature masculine is [penultimate goal completed by theosis/natural expression of theosis/other].
```

### On Hierarchy

```
I believe hierarchy is [natural/constructed/both in different senses].
This is grounded in [caste-nature/formation/calling/gifts/other].
The implications for social order are [specific].
```

## The Test

When this document moves from ◐ to ◉, it will contain:

> "I believe man is _____. Archetypes are _____. Human telos is _____. Hierarchy is grounded in _____. This commits me to _____."

The archetype-theology relationship must be clarified.

## Composition

**This document was informed by:**
- `fw-worldview-architectonic` (method)
- `idx-bedford-credo` (the credo index)
- `fw-four-knowings` (Vervaeke's framework)
- KWML work (Robert Moore, self-diagnosis)
- Traditionalist anthropology (Evola)

**This document enables:**
- `inst-credo-ethics` (what ought we do depends on what we are)
- `inst-credo-political` (legitimate hierarchy depends on human nature)
- `inst-credo-ecclesiology` (what the church is for depends on what man is for)
