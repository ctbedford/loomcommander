# Recon: Economic Genealogy

**Date initiated:** 2026-01-09
**Last updated:** 2026-01-09 (Execute mode collection)
**Domain:** Economic Genealogy — the philological archaeology of economic concepts
**Intent:** Populate strategic categories to support the Etymon channel's economic vocabulary recovery project
**Scope:** Terms and structures that govern modern economic thought but whose buried meanings reveal different possibilities

---

## Strategic Context

The project: Etymon channel recovers degraded concepts by excavating their original operational meanings. The economic vocabulary is a primary target — words like "capital," "credit," "interest" once carried relational, bounded, mortal meanings that modern usage has stripped away.

The thesis (from Oikonomia vs Chrematistics): Modern economics is chrematistic by definition — the study of unlimited wants meeting scarce means. The oikonomic frame (bounded household, telos, flourishing) is absent from the discipline. Economic genealogy traces this drift and recovers alternatives.

## Key Findings from This Collection

### DEBT (inst-excavate-debt)

**Etymology:** Latin *debitum* → but the German *Schuld* means BOTH debt AND guilt

**The discovery:** No other Western European language preserves this unity. Romance languages split them (Spanish: *deuda* vs *culpa*). The Lord's Prayer in German: "Vergib uns unsere Schulden" — forgive us our debts/guilt.

**Drift:** Social obligation → financial instrument. Strategic default erases the guilt structure.

**Recovery:** Debt is subordination. The debtor is in the creditor's power. Recovering Schuld would restore friction.

**Operator:** DEBT AND GUILT (the systematic connection)

---

### MORTGAGE (inst-excavate-mortgage)

**Etymology:** Old French *mort gage* — literally "death pledge"

**The discovery:** The deal must die — either by payment (debt dies) or by forfeiture (property dies to you). Sir Edward Coke (1664) explained it as a pledge that ends in death.

**Drift:** Death pledge → "product." 30-year commitments spoken of as purchases.

**Recovery:** Hear the death. "Getting a mortgage" = giving a death pledge on your shelter.

**Operator:** MORTGAGE AS Death Pledge

---

### WEALTH (inst-excavate-wealth)

**Etymology:** Old English *wela* = well-being, prosperity. Same root as "well" and "will."

**The discovery:** Wealth meant HOW YOU ARE, not WHAT YOU HAVE. The narrowing (~1250-1430) reduced flourishing to fortune. "Commonwealth" preserves the old sense.

**Drift:** Well-being → assets. You can have enough well-being; you cannot have enough assets.

**Recovery:** This IS the oikonomic concept. Wealth-as-wela has a satiation point. Wealth-as-assets doesn't.

**Operator:** WEALTH AS Well-Being

---

### Polanyi (src-polanyi-great-transformation)

**Core thesis:** Economies were once **embedded** in social relations. The "great transformation" was their **disembedding** — making labor, land, and money into fictitious commodities.

**Key vocabulary:**
- **Embeddedness** — economy subordinate to society (oikonomic)
- **Disembedding** — economy separated from society (chrematistic)
- **Commodity fiction** — treating labor/land/money as if produced for sale
- **Double movement** — society's spontaneous self-protection against full commodification

**Significance:** Provides the historical-anthropological frame for the drift. Market society is not natural — it was created through state violence in 18th-19th century England.

---

### Graeber (src-graeber-debt)

**Core thesis:** Credit came before coin. The "myth of barter" (barter → money → credit) is backwards. Actual history: credit → coins → barter (only when systems collapse).

**Key vocabulary:**
- **Myth of barter** — the false origin story economists tell
- **Human economies** — where persons cannot be quantified
- **Commercial economies** — where violence enables quantification
- **Primordial debt** — the state's claim that you owe an unpayable debt (legitimation technique)

**Significance:** Debt is not neutral financial instrument — it's social relationship tied to power and violence. The German *Schuld* is not accident; it's evidence.

## Analysis

### Diagnostic Assessment (updated)

The three new excavations confirm the pattern:

1. **DEBT** — Moral weight → neutral instrument. The Schuld (guilt) disappears; "strategic default" becomes thinkable.

2. **MORTGAGE** — Mortality visible → mortality hidden. You no longer hear the death in death-pledge; it's just a "product."

3. **WEALTH** — Qualitative → quantitative. Well-being shrinks to net worth; flourishing becomes fortune.

All three demonstrate the same chrematistic drift: what was bounded, mortal, relational, moral becomes unbounded, immortal, calculable, neutral.

### Strategic Assessment (updated)

**New leverage points from this collection:**

1. **WEALTH as well-being** — This is the positive oikonomic concept. Recovery here is not just critique but alternative. "Are you wealthy?" = "Are you well?"

2. **DEBT as guilt** — The Schuld connection is dramatic. Bilingual demonstration (German Lord's Prayer) makes the recovery vivid.

3. **MORTGAGE as death pledge** — Most people have mortgages. Naming it "death pledge" creates immediate recognition and unease.

**Graeber + Polanyi provide genealogical grounding:**
- Polanyi: Market society is not natural (embeddedness → disembedding)
- Graeber: Debt is not neutral (credit-as-trust → credit-as-calculation)

Both support the oikonomia/chrematistics frame with anthropological-historical evidence.
