# CAPITAL

**Type:** Instance
**Frameworks:** Etymon Method, Oikonomia vs Chrematistics
**Output:** Etymon
**Status:** Verified

## CAPITAL FROM Cattle

The operator: **FROM** — traces derivation

## I. THE WORD

**Latin:** *caput* — head
**Medieval Latin:** *capitale* — property, stock, principal sum
**The bridge:** *capita* — heads of cattle, counted individually
**Related:** *pecuniary* from *pecus* (cattle); *fee* from Germanic *fehu* (livestock)

---

## II. EXCAVATION

### The Head

*Caput* is the head. The chief thing. What sits at the top. Capital punishment is losing your head. The capital city is where the head of state sits.

The head is where life is. Where decision happens. Where the face meets the world.

### The Cattle

Wealth was counted in heads. *Capita*. How many head of cattle do you own?

This is not metaphor — it's the literal origin of countable wealth. Cattle were:
- **Moveable** (unlike land)
- **Countable** (unlike grain in a silo)
- **Reproductive** (they make more of themselves)
- **Mortal** (they die, they require care, they have limits)

Money remembers animals. The head count was the wealth count. Your *capital* was your heads.

### The Principal

When money lending formalized, the principal sum was called *capitale*. The interest was the increase, the offspring. But the capital was the head — the chief thing.

This preserves the cattle logic: the principal is the breeding stock. Interest is what it produces. You don't eat the breeding stock.

---

## III. DRIFT

### From Heads to Fund

Capital stops being countable heads and becomes an abstract fund. Not "300 head of cattle" but "a capital of 300 pounds." The abstraction seems innocent. But cattle exist somewhere. They require pasture. They get sick. They die. A "fund" floats free.

### From Mortal to Immortal

Cattle die. Every rancher knows the herd must be maintained, replaced, renewed. Wealth-as-cattle has a built-in horizon. It requires *tending*.

Capital-as-fund doesn't die. It can compound infinitely. The logic of the livestock — bounded by biology, by carrying capacity — disappears. This is when chrematistics wins.

### From Object to Subject

The deepest drift: capital becomes an *agent*.

"Capital seeks returns." "Capital flows to opportunity." "Capital demands efficiency."

We speak as if capital *does things*. The human holding capital disappears. Capital itself becomes the protagonist. When capital is the subject, people become the means.

### From Stock to Logic

Final form: "capitalism." Not capital as something you have, but capital as *organizing principle*. The word no longer means your heads of cattle. It means the system. The totality.

## IV. FOR PART III: READING THE BALANCE SHEET

**Assets vs. Capital:** Assets are what the firm *has*. Capital appears on the right side — how assets were *funded*. Debt capital (someone else's heads, lent). Equity capital (owners' heads, at risk). The balance sheet maps whose heads are at stake.

**The Capital Stack:** Senior debt, junior debt, mezzanine, preferred equity, common equity. A hierarchy of heads. Who loses their head first? The stack is mortality in slow motion.

**Return on Capital:** ROC asks: what did the heads produce? High ROC means the heads are productive. Low ROC means you're running too many cattle for the grass.

---

## V. RECOVERY

Three questions to hold:

1. **Whose head is this?** When you read "capital," ask: who decides its deployment? Who bears the consequences?
2. **What's the carrying capacity?** How much capital can this system support before overgrazing?
3. **What tending does it require?** Capital deployed in a business requires management, maintenance, reinvestment. What happens if it isn't tended?

---

## VI. THE SCRIPT STRUCTURE

**Hook:** "Capital" means head. As in: decapitate. As in: the heads of cattle your grandfather counted. Somewhere between the ranch and the Bloomberg terminal, the head disappeared.

**Excavation:** The Latin, the cattle, the principal sum. What the word knew.

**Drift:** Fund replaces herd. Immortality replaces mortality. Agent replaces object. System replaces stock.

**Stakes:** When capital loses its head, we stop asking whose. The faceless fund seems to have its own desires. But capital is someone's heads. Recovering the head means recovering the person.

**Recovery:** Three questions. Whose head? What's the carrying capacity? What tending?

**Close:** The rancher counted heads because heads could be lost. Capital that can't be lost, that doesn't die, that tends itself — that's not wealth. That's something else. The word remembers what we've forgotten.

---

## The Compression

**CAPITAL:** From heads of cattle to abstract accumulation. Living wealth became undying wealth. The herd that could die became the fund that compounds forever. Recovery means remembering that real capital is mortal — and asking what dies when it dies.
