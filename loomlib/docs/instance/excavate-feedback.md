# Excavation: FEEDBACK

**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Status:** research (pre-production)

### Etymology

**Root:** English compound, "feed" + "back"
**Literal meaning:** To return nourishment to the source; output returning to input
**First attested:**
- 1860s: Verb phrase "to feed back" (mechanical process)
- 1909: Karl Ferdinand Braun used "feed-back" as noun (electronic circuits)
- 1919: British patent GB130432 ("a feed back circuit")
- 1920: "Feedback" as distinct single word

**Sources consulted:**
- Merriam-Webster: "The History of Feedback"
- Oxford English Dictionary
- Wikipedia: Feedback, Cybernetics

**Findings:**

The word emerged from electrical engineering, not biology or psychology. Its origin is strikingly concrete: in early amplifier circuits (audions), engineers discovered that "coupling part of the output signal back to the input circuit" would boost amplification—but also cause the device to "howl or sing."

The word names a *loop*: output returns to input, modifying subsequent output. This circularity is not metaphorical but structural. A feed-back circuit is literally wired to feed its output back to its input.

**Cybernetic deepening:** Norbert Wiener (1948) formalized feedback as the core mechanism of *cybernetics*, from Greek κυβερνητικός (kubernētikos)—"good at steering." The helmsman metaphor: you adjust the rudder based on the ship's observed course, and that adjustment produces new observations, which produce new adjustments. Circular causality. The goal is *homeostasis*: maintaining equilibrium despite disturbance.

### Semantic History

**Key inflection points:**

1. **1860s-1920s (MECHANICAL)**: Verb phrase → noun. Describes physical/electrical phenomenon. Output returning to input in machinery.

2. **1924 (POLARITY)**: Friis and Jensen distinguish "positive feed-back" (amplifying) from "negative feed-back" (dampening). These are technical terms describing loop behavior, not value judgments.

3. **1930s (AUDIO)**: "Feedback" becomes popularly known through radio and amplification—the howl, screech, and hum of microphone feedback. The word enters common vocabulary.

4. **1940s (PSYCHOLOGY)**: The crucial drift. "Feedback" begins appearing in psychology literature meaning "helpful information or criticism about performance." First documented uses show the word migrating from systems to persons.

5. **1950s-60s (MANAGEMENT)**: Feedback systems become "standard practice of all modern management." The word is now about evaluation, not equilibrium.

6. **1990s-present (CORPORATE)**: "Feedback culture" emerges. The word now predominantly means one-directional evaluation delivered from authority to subordinate. The loop has vanished.

**The drift pattern:** CIRCULAR → LINEAR, SYSTEMIC → PERSONAL, HOMEOSTATIC → EVALUATIVE

### Contemporary Usage

**Dominant meaning:** "Helpful information or criticism given to someone about their performance or behavior"

**What's lost:**

1. **The loop itself.** Original feedback was structural: output *actually returns* to input, completing a circuit. Contemporary "giving feedback" is a one-way transmission. There is no loop. The giver speaks; the receiver listens. Nothing feeds back.

2. **Circularity / mutual modification.** In a true feedback loop, both parties change. The helmsman adjusts the rudder AND the ship's course affects the helmsman's next adjustment. In corporate feedback, only the receiver is supposed to change.

3. **System orientation.** Feedback was about the *system* maintaining course. Now it's about the *individual* being corrected. The unit of analysis shifted from relationship to person.

4. **Homeostasis.** Original purpose: equilibrium, stability, staying on course despite disturbance. Current purpose: improvement, correction, change. These are opposite orientations—stability vs. change.

5. **Technical neutrality of positive/negative.** "Positive feedback" meant amplifying (potentially destabilizing). "Negative feedback" meant dampening (stabilizing). Now they're moral categories: good feedback vs. bad feedback.

**What's distorted:**

The word now *obscures* what it originally *revealed*. When we say "let me give you some feedback," we use a systems word to perform a non-systemic act. We invoke circularity to deliver linearity. We claim mutual regulation while enacting hierarchy.

The distortion is ideological: it makes one-directional judgment sound scientific, mutual, and technical. "Feedback" launders critique through the prestige of cybernetics.

### Recovery Hypothesis

**Claim:** Feedback names a circular relationship in which output modifies input. Without the loop, it isn't feedback—it's judgment, evaluation, or critique.

**The test:** When someone offers "feedback," ask: *What loop does this complete? What feeds back to what?* If there's no loop—if information flows one way and only one party is supposed to change—then call it what it is: assessment, criticism, direction, correction. Reserve "feedback" for actual loops.

**Application:**

- **True feedback:** Your response to my last move changes my next move, which changes your next response, which changes my subsequent move. Conversation as feedback loop. Improvisation as feedback loop. Market prices as feedback loop.

- **False feedback:** Manager tells employee what to improve. Employee is supposed to change. Manager's behavior is not in question. No loop. This is *instruction* or *evaluation*, not feedback.

**Recovery enables:**

1. Honesty about power. "I have feedback for you" often means "I have authority over you." Recovery exposes this.

2. Designing actual loops. If you want real feedback, build structures where output returns to input—where the "giver" is also affected by what they give.

3. Recognizing when homeostasis applies. Some situations need stability (negative feedback). Others need transformation (not feedback at all—intervention, disruption, change).

**Stakes:**

The corruption of "feedback" lets hierarchical organizations pretend to be learning systems. It lets one-way power flows masquerade as mutual adjustment. Recovery restores the ability to see when genuine circular causality is present—and when it's absent but rhetorically invoked.

### Production Readiness

**Ready for instance?** Yes

**Operator:** FEEDBACK AS LOOP (versus FEEDBACK AS JUDGMENT)

The excavation reveals a clean opposition: the original (loop, circular, systemic, homeostatic) versus the drifted (linear, hierarchical, personal, corrective). This is ripe for an AS structure.

**Alternative operators:**
- FEEDBACK WITHOUT LOOP — what gets called feedback when the loop is missing
- FEEDBACK VERSUS CRITIQUE — distinguishing genuine circular causality from one-way evaluation

**Suggested formula:** Etymon Method + Oikonomia/Chrematistics lens

The drift from feedback-as-homeostasis to feedback-as-evaluation mirrors the drift from oikonomia (household flourishing) to chrematistics (extraction). In both cases, a relational/systemic concept becomes instrumental and one-directional.

**To strengthen before production:**
- [ ] Read Wiener's *Cybernetics* directly for original formulation
- [ ] Find the specific 1940s psychology texts where drift began
- [ ] Develop concrete examples of true vs. false feedback in organizations
