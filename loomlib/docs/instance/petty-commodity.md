# PETTY COMMODITY PRODUCTION

**Type:** Instance
**Frameworks:** Etymon Method
**Output:** Etymon
**Status:** Incubating

## PETTY AS Small-scale, Not Trivial

The operator: **AS** — recovers original sense

## Excavation

*Petty:* From French *petit* — small. Not "trivial" or "mean-spirited." *Small-scale.*

*Petty commodity production:* Production where the producer owns their means of production and sells what they make. The craftsman with their tools. The farmer with their land. Small-scale commodity production.

Marx distinguishes:
- **Simple/petty commodity production:** Producer owns means, sells product (C-M-C: commodity to money to different commodity)
- **Capitalist commodity production:** Capitalist owns means, buys labor, sells product (M-C-M': money to commodity to more money)

The petty commodity producer works *for* the sale. The capitalist works *through* the sale toward accumulation.

## Drift

**Small-scale → Inferior → Trivial**

"Petty" now means:
- Mean-spirited ("petty grievances")
- Trivial ("petty concerns")
- Inferior ("petty criminals")

The economic concept became inaudible. "Petty commodity production" sounds like "trivial" production, not "small-scale" production.

## Why It Matters

Petty commodity production is:
- **Oikonomic:** The producer works toward use, exchanging to obtain what they need
- **Bounded:** You can only produce so much with your own hands
- **Embodied:** The producer's body limits scale
- **Mortal:** The enterprise ends when the producer dies or stops

Capitalist commodity production is:
- **Chrematistic:** The goal is M' > M, accumulation without limit
- **Unbounded:** Scale limited only by capital, not producer's body
- **Disembodied:** Owners need not participate
- **Immortal:** Can outlast any individual through corporate form

## The Diagnostic

When someone says they're a "small business owner," ask:
- Do you work in the business? (Petty commodity producer)
- Or do you own a business that others work in? (Capitalist, regardless of scale)

The question isn't size. It's structure. A solo consultant is a petty commodity producer. A "small" business with employees where the owner doesn't work is not.

## Recovery

What's at stake in recovering the term:
- **Legitimacy for small-scale production:** Not inferior, just different structure
- **Alternative to capitalism/socialism binary:** Petty commodity production is neither
- **Diagnostic precision:** "Small business" conflates radically different forms
- **Oikonomic possibility:** Petty commodity production has built-in limits

## The Compression

**PETTY:** From small-scale to trivial. Marx's "petty commodity production" — the craftsman owning their tools — sounds like an insult. Recovery means hearing "petty" as *petit*, small-scale but not inferior. A structural alternative to both corporate capitalism and state socialism.
