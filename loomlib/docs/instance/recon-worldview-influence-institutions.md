# Recon: Worldview Influence Institutions

**Purpose:** Map the institutions that hold marketshare of influence over worldview formation in America and internationally, organized by the ten credo categories. Understand who shapes what people believe, by what means, and where alternative positions can gain traction.

---

## The Question

For each worldview category:
1. **Who holds influence?** — Which institutions shape popular belief?
2. **By what means?** — Education, media, cultural production, law, funding?
3. **What position do they propagate?** — Which of the options from `fw-worldview-architectonic`?
4. **Where is dissent possible?** — Entry points for alternative positions?

---

## I. Metaphysics: What Is Real?

### Dominant Position: Practical Materialism

The explicit philosophical question is not asked. The functional answer is materialism — only what can be measured is real.

### Institutions of Influence

| Institution | Means | Position | Reach |
|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| **K-12 Education** (public) | Curriculum, testing | Implicit materialism (science as only knowledge) | Universal in US |
| **Universities** (research) | PhD production, grants, prestige | Explicit materialism in philosophy departments | Elite formation |
| **Popular Science Media** | Dawkins, Tyson, pop physics | "Science vs. Religion" frame | Mass market |
| **Tech Industry** | Product design, metrics, optimization | Quantified self, data as reality | Daily interface |
| **Medical/Pharma** | Disease model, treatment protocols | Body as machine | Health decisions |

### Alternative Position Holders

| Institution | Means | Position |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Traditional Churches** (Orthodox, Trad Catholic) | Liturgy, catechesis | Sacramental realism |
| **Perennialist Networks** | Books, online forums, retreats | Traditionalist hierarchy |
| **Integral/Metamodern** (Wilber, Vervaeke) | YouTube, podcasts, courses | Process, participatory metaphysics |
| **Jungian Institutes** | Training, publishing | Psyche as real, archetypes |

### Marketshare Assessment

**Dominant:** ~85% functional materialism (never explicitly examined)
**Active Alternative:** ~5-10% religious metaphysics (among practicing believers)
**Intellectual Alternative:** <5% Traditionalist, Integral, or Process metaphysics

---

## II. Theology: Who Is God?

### Dominant Position: Therapeutic Moral Deism

Not atheism, but a vague "God" who wants you to be happy and good. No incarnation, no judgment, no sacraments.

### Institutions of Influence

| Institution | Means | Position | Reach |
|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Mainline Protestantism** (PCUSA, ELCA, UMC, Episcopal) | Pulpit, denominational structure | Progressive Christianity → MTD | Declining but institutional |
| **Megachurch Evangelicalism** | Worship experience, small groups | Emotional theism, light on doctrine | Growing, especially suburban |
| **Hollywood/Streaming** | Narrative, representation | Spirituality without religion | Mass consumption |
| **Oprah/Wellness Industry** | Talk shows, books, apps | Perennialist lite, "your truth" | Female mass market |
| **Education** (religious studies) | Comparative religion courses | All religions same, none true | College-educated |
| **New Atheism** (declining) | Books, debates | No god, religion harmful | Fading but residual |

### Alternative Position Holders

| Institution | Means | Position |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Eastern Orthodoxy** | Liturgy, monasteries, converts | Trinitarian, sacramental, theosis |
| **Traditional Catholicism** (FSSP, ICKSP, SSPX) | TLM communities, homeschool networks | Pre-Vatican II Catholicism |
| **Reformed/Presbyterian** (PCA, OPC) | Confessional preaching, seminaries | Calvinist orthodoxy |
| **Southern Baptist Convention** | Size, institutions, missions | Evangelical orthodoxy (contested internally) |
| **Traditionalist Schools** (Guénon readers) | Books, small networks | Perennialism — all traditions access one reality |

### Marketshare Assessment

**Dominant:** ~60% MTD / vague theism (among those with any belief)
**Evangelical:** ~25% (various levels of doctrinal specificity)
**Orthodox/Traditional Catholic:** ~2-3% (small but intense)
**Mainline declining:** ~10% (institutional legacy)
**Secular/Atheist:** ~25% of population (rising)

### Key Tension

The "Christian question" from `inst-credo-theology` — is Christ unique or exemplary? — is answered by most institutions as "exemplary" (implicitly, via comparative religion framing) or "irrelevant" (secular). Explicit Christological orthodoxy is minority position.

---

## III. Anthropology: What Is Man?

### Dominant Position: Liberal Expressive Individualism

Man is a rights-bearing individual whose purpose is self-expression and self-actualization. Identity is chosen, not given.

### Institutions of Influence

| Institution | Means | Position | Reach |
|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| **K-12 Education** | SEL curriculum, "finding yourself" | Self-actualization as goal | Universal |

| **Classical Education** (Hillsdale, Great Hearts) | Curriculum, schools | Fixed human nature, virtue |
| **Traditionalist Right** | Online, small publishers | Caste-nature, hierarchy |

### Marketshare Assessment

**Dominant:** ~70% expressive individualism (default)
**Peterson-adjacent:** ~10% (large audience, unclear depth)
**Religious anthropology:** ~15% (among practicing believers)
**Traditionalist/Archetypal:** <5% (intellectual minority)

---

## IV. Epistemology: How Do We Know?

### Dominant Position: Scientism + Emotivism

Science is the only valid knowledge; everything else is opinion or feeling. But feelings are valid for personal decisions.

**Religious epistemology:** ~15% (among believers who think about it)
**Alternative academic:** <5% (small intellectual networks)

---

## V. Ethics: What Is Good?

### Dominant Position: Consequentialism + Harm Principle

Actions are judged by outcomes, and the primary bad outcome is harm (to individuals or groups). No intrinsic goods or evils.

### Institutions of Influence

| Institution | Means | Position | Reach |
|-------------|-------|----------|-------|

**Traditional moral theology:** ~10% (practicing traditional believers)
**Deontological:** <5% (academic)

## VI. Political Philosophy: What Is Legitimate Order?

### Dominant Position: Liberal Proceduralism

Authority derives from consent. Legitimacy is procedural (elections, rights, due process). Neutrality between conceptions of the good.

### Institutions of Influence

| **Civics Education** | Curriculum | Constitution worship, process | Formation |

### Alternative Position Holders (Right)

| Institution | Means | Position |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| **DSA / Jacobin** | Organizing, magazine | Democratic socialism |
| **Critical Theory depts** | Academic | Critique of liberalism from left |
| **Movement Left** | Activism | Direct action, not proceduralism |

### Marketshare Assessment

**Dominant:** ~65% procedural liberalism (assumed, not examined)
**Populist discontent:** ~25% (knows something is wrong, no clear alternative)
**Post-liberal Right:** ~5% (intellectual, growing)
**Socialist Left:** ~5% (younger demographics)

### Key Tension

Your position — "authority must recognize something above itself" + "regional thickness within federal structure" — has no institutional home. Closest: National Conservatism, First Things, American Compass. But none fully articulate transcendent grounding without integralism.

---

## VII. Economics: What Is Wealth For?

### Dominant Position: Neoliberalism (Free Markets + Globalization)

Efficiency is the goal. Markets allocate best. Free trade benefits all. Government should minimize intervention.

### Institutions of Influence

| **MMT Left** (Kelton) | Academic, popular | Government as employer | Different frame |
| **Piketty / inequality focus** | Academic, media | Redistribution | Different telos |

### Marketshare Assessment

**Dominant:** ~70% neoliberal assumptions (even among critics)
**Heterodox Right (Listian):** ~5% (but growing, institutional homes emerging)
**Heterodox Left:** ~10% (MMT, inequality focus)
**Distributist/Localist:** ~2% (small but committed)

### Key Alignment

Your position — List, oikonomia, American System — now has institutional homes: American Compass, American Affairs, Compact. This was not true 10 years ago. Overton window shifting.

**Spenglerian/Traditionalist:** <5% (intellectual minority)

---

## IX. Eschatology: What Is the End?

### Dominant Position: Implicit Materialism / This-Worldly Hope

Either no afterlife (secular) or vague heaven (MTD). Hope is for this-world improvement.

### Institutions of Influence

| Institution | Means | Position | Reach |
|-------------|-------|----------|-------|

---

## X. Ecclesiology: Where Is the Church?

### Dominant Position: Irrelevance or Consumer Choice

Church is either irrelevant (secular) or a consumer choice (spiritual marketplace).

### Institutions of Influence

| Institution | Means | Position | Reach |
|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Secular Culture** | Default | Religion is private, declining | Majority |
| **Megachurch Model** | Marketing, experience | Church as service provider | Growing segment |
| **Spiritual But Not Religious** | Individual, syncretistic | No church needed | Large and growing |
| **Mainline Decline** | Institutional inertia | Irrelevance | Fading |

### Alternative Position Holders

The decision in `inst-credo-ecclesiology` requires visiting:
- **Orthodox parishes** in NW Arkansas (Antiochian, Greek, OCA?)
- **TLM communities** (FSSP? Diocesan TLM?)
- **ACNA parishes** (Anglican)

Find what exists locally. The institutional question is also a geographic question.

## Meta-Institutional Categories

### Cross-Cutting Influence Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Institutions | Effect |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Elite Formation** | Universities, law schools, business schools | Shapes who leads |
| **Information Gatekeeping** | Media, platforms, fact-checkers | Shapes what's thinkable |
| **Funding Flows** | Foundations, donors, grants | Shapes what gets built |
| **Credentialing** | Accreditation, licensing, degrees | Shapes who speaks |
| **Legal Infrastructure** | Courts, regulatory agencies | Shapes what's permissible |
| **Cultural Production** | Hollywood, publishing, music | Shapes what's desirable |

### Foundations That Fund Worldview

| Foundation | Tendency | Budget |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **Ford Foundation** | Progressive | ~$700M/year |
| **Open Society (Soros)** | Progressive, internationalist | ~$1B/year |
| **MacArthur Foundation** | Progressive | ~$300M/year |
| **Rockefeller Brothers** | Progressive | ~$45M/year |
| **Koch Network** | Libertarian | ~$400M/year |
| **Bradley Foundation** | Conservative | ~$50M/year |
| **Templeton Foundation** | Religious/scientific | ~$150M/year |
| **Opus Dei / Knights of Columbus** | Traditional Catholic | Unknown |

**Observation:** Progressive foundations outspend conservative by ~5:1 or more. This explains institutional tilt.

## Strategic Implications

### Where Are the Gaps?

| Category | Dominant | Alternative Gap |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Metaphysics | Implicit materialism | No institutional articulation of sacramental realism outside churches |
| Theology | MTD | Traditional orthodoxy has institutions but shrinking |
| Anthropology | Expressive individualism | Peterson showed demand; no institutional capture |
| Epistemology | Scientism | Vervaeke model has no institution; churches don't emphasize |
| Ethics | Harm principle | Natural law has some law school presence; virtue ethics academic only |
| Political Philosophy | Procedural liberalism | Post-liberal right has emerging institutions (Compact, American Compass) |
| Economics | Neoliberalism | **Best positioned** — American Compass, American Affairs, Compact |
| Philosophy of History | Progressivism | No institution for alternative; mostly individual thinkers |
| Eschatology | Vague/materialist | Only traditional churches hold alternative |
| Ecclesiology | Consumer/irrelevant | The churches themselves are the institution |

### Where Your Position Has Institutional Homes

| Category | Your Position | Institutional Home |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Economics** | Listian, oikonomia | American Compass, American Affairs, Compact |
| **Political Philosophy** | Post-liberal, regional | Compact, American Compass, National Conservatism |
| **Anthropology** | Archetypal, KWML | Peterson orbit (audience, not institution); Men's Work networks |
| **Epistemology** | Four knowings | Vervaeke (no institution); you would have to build |
| **Theology/Ecclesiology** | Orthodox-leaning | Orthodox Church (but you must join) |

### Where You Would Have to Build

| Category | Gap | What Would Be Needed |
|----------|-----|---------------------|
| **Metaphysics** | No institution for sacramental realism + Traditionalist insight | Publication? School? |
| **Epistemology** | Participatory knowing has no home | Curriculum? Training program? |
| **Philosophy of History** | Spengler + Christian eschatology synthesis | Publication? |
| **Ethics** | Ilyin's tragic realism unknown | Translation, publication |

## Composition

**This document was informed by:**
- `fw-worldview-architectonic` (the ten categories)
- `fw-recon-method` (collection → processing → analysis)
- `idx-user-commitments` (calibration — where your positions align)
- Prior recon work (`inst-recon-american-compass`, etc.)

**This document enables:**
- Strategic decisions about engagement
- Ecclesiology decision (what exists locally)
- Understanding of Overton window by category
- Assessment of where to build vs. join vs. influence

**Calibration Note:**
This is Magician work — mapping terrain. The Warrior task: pick one category where institutions exist (economics? ecclesiology?) and act. The map is for orientation, not endless refinement.
