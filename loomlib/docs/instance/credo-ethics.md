# Credo V: Ethics — What Is Good?

**The Question:** What ought we do? What makes actions right or wrong?

**Status:** ◐ Articulated via Ilyin
**Action Required:** Define red lines

---

## The Commitment (ARTICULATED)

What is already held:

> "I would rather bear my sin to act in good intention than to not act in fear that I am in violation of the sacred."

This is:
- Grace-dependent action, not Pelagian earning
- Tragic realism — action in a fallen world always involves sin
- Rejection of both consequentialism and rigid deontology
- The statesman bears his sin, confesses, trusts grace, acts again
- Inaction is also sin — stewardship requires deployment

What remains to define:

> What are the red lines — sins you will not bear even for good ends? Where does "bearing sin" become "rationalizing evil"?

---

## The Strong Positions

### Ilyin's Framework

Ivan Ilyin (1883-1954), Russian philosopher:
- Action in a fallen world always involves sin
- The statesman cannot keep his hands clean
- Inaction is not innocence — failing to act when action is required is also sin
- The question is not "how to avoid sin" but "how to act despite sin"
- Grace covers the sin of the one who acts with good intention and confesses

**Your Articulation:**
> "I would rather bear my sin to act in good intention than to not act in fear that I am in violation of the sacred."

This is a commitment. You will act, knowing you may sin, trusting grace.

### Grace-Dependent Action

Not Pelagian:
- You do not earn salvation by works
- You cannot make yourself righteous by correct action
- Grace is primary — action is response to grace

Not quietist:
- Grace does not mean passivity
- "Faith without works is dead"
- Stewardship requires deployment of talents

**The Synthesis:**
- Act because you are forgiven, not to be forgiven
- Act knowing you will sin, trusting confession and grace
- Act because inaction is also sin — omission, not just commission

### Tragic Realism

The world is fallen. Action in it is never pure:
- Hiring one person means not hiring another
- Competing means someone else loses
- Protecting your family may harm another's
- Every choice closes off other choices

**Consequentialism** says: Calculate outcomes, maximize good.
*Problem:* You cannot see all outcomes. And this licenses terrible means.

**Deontology** says: Follow rules, regardless of outcomes.
*Problem:* Rigid rules in complex situations can produce evil (lying to Nazis to save Jews).

**Ilyin's position** says: Act with good intention, bear the sin, trust grace.
*Advantage:* Acknowledges the tragic without becoming calculating or rigid.

### Inaction is Also Sin

The Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25):
- The servant who buried his talent was condemned
- Not for doing evil, but for failing to act
- Stewardship requires risk

**Your Position:**
- You would rather act and be wrong than fail to act
- The Warrior underdevelopment (90% Magician) is a form of this sin — knowing without doing
- Etymon Episode 1 not shipping is a form of this sin

---

## The Tension: Red Lines

Ilyin's framework is powerful but dangerous. Without limits, "bearing sin" becomes rationalization.

### The Question

What sins will you not bear even for good ends?

**The Test Cases:**

| Action | Would You Bear This Sin? |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Lying to protect someone | Yes (most would agree) |
| Breaking a promise for greater good | Depends on the promise |
| Firing someone who needs the job | Yes (business requires it) |
| Paying below living wage | ? |
| Competing in ways that harm others | ? |
| Political action that violates stated principles | ? |
| Violence in defense of family | Yes (most would agree) |
| Violence in defense of cause | ? |
| Deception in business | ? |
| Silence in face of injustice | ? (but inaction is also sin) |

### Possible Red Lines

1. **Intrinsic evils** — Some acts are always wrong regardless of intention or outcome
   - Murder (not killing in war or self-defense, but murder)
   - Torture
   - Rape
   - Blasphemy
   - Direct lying about God or fundamental truths

2. **Threshold harms** — Some harms are so severe that no good end justifies them
   - Genocide
   - Enslavement
   - Destruction of innocents

3. **Corruption of soul** — Some actions, even if "successful," destroy the actor
   - Habitual deception that erodes integrity
   - Cruelty that hardens the heart
   - Cowardice that becomes character

4. **Violation of specific commitments** — Some promises are inviolable
   - Marriage vows
   - Oaths of office
   - Specific promises to specific persons

### The Distinction

**Bearing sin** = Acting with good intention in a situation where no clean option exists, confessing, trusting grace.

**Rationalizing evil** = Pretending the sin isn't sin, or claiming the end justifies any means, or refusing confession.

**The difference:**
- Bearing sin acknowledges the sin
- Rationalizing evil denies it
- Bearing sin confesses
- Rationalizing evil excuses
- Bearing sin trusts grace
- Rationalizing evil trusts self-justification

---

## The Virtue Framework

Ilyin provides the tragic; virtue ethics provides the telos.

### The Question Changes

Not "what should I do?" but "what kind of person should I be?"

**The Cardinal Virtues:**
- Prudence — Right reason in action
- Justice — Giving each their due
- Fortitude — Courage in difficulty
- Temperance — Moderation of appetite

**The Theological Virtues:**
- Faith — Trust in God
- Hope — Confident expectation of good
- Charity — Love of God and neighbor

**The Ilyin Addition:**
- The willingness to bear sin rather than fail to act
- Confession as regular practice
- Grace-dependence as habit

## The Confession Required

### On the Framework

```

```

### On Bearing Sin

```
I am willing to bear sin in action when [conditions].
I trust grace for [what specifically].
I confess [how often/to whom].
```

### On Red Lines

```
I will not bear the following sins even for good ends:
1. [Specific red line]
2. [Specific red line]
3. [Specific red line]

These are non-negotiable because [reason].
```

### On the Distinction

```
The difference between bearing sin and rationalizing evil is:
- Bearing sin involves [confession/acknowledgment/grace-dependence]
- Rationalizing evil involves [denial/excuse/self-justification]
```
