# American System VERSUS Globalist Arrangement

**Operator:** VERSUS (structured contrast between two national arrangements)
**Date:** 2025-01-09

---

## The Two Arrangements

| Dimension | American System | Globalist Arrangement |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Period** | 1791-1945 (origin to dissolution) | 1944-present (Bretton Woods to now) |
| **Unit of analysis** | The nation | The "international community" / global economy |
| **Core principle** | National productive capacity | Free movement of capital, goods, people |
| **State role** | Developmental agent | Rule-enforcer for global markets |
| **Legitimating theory** | List's developmental nationalism | Smith's cosmopolitan economics (as ideology) |
| **Whose interests?** | National producers, workers, posterity | Capital, consumers, "humanity" |

---

## The Globalist Arrangement: Structure

### Origin (1944-1971)

**Founding moment:** Bretton Woods Conference (1944)

The United States, having achieved industrial supremacy partly through the American System, now inverted its position — preaching the free trade it had once rejected. This is List's "kicking away the ladder" in action.

**Initial architecture:**

| Institution | Founded | Function |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **IMF** | 1944 | Currency stabilization, balance of payments |
| **World Bank** | 1944 | Development lending (on Washington's terms) |
| **GATT** | 1947 | Tariff reduction, trade liberalization |
| **BIS** | 1930 (repurposed) | Central bank coordination |
| **Federal Reserve** | 1913 (elevated) | Dollar as reserve currency; de facto global central bank |

**The arrangement's logic:** Dollar-gold convertibility anchors system → US provides liquidity → other nations rebuild behind American security umbrella → trade liberalizes gradually → US benefits as dominant manufacturer.

**Note:** This early phase was still semi-developmental for allies (Marshall Plan, tolerated protection in Europe/Japan). Full cosmopolitanism came later.

---

### Expansion (1971-1991)

**Nixon Shock (1971):** Dollar-gold convertibility ends. Pure fiat regime.

**Key developments:**
- Floating exchange rates → financial instability → need for coordination
- Petrodollar system → dollar hegemony without gold anchor
- Volcker Shock (1979) → high interest rates → Third World debt crisis → IMF structural adjustment
- Reagan/Thatcher deregulation → financial liberalization → capital mobility

**Institutional evolution:**

| Institution | Change | Effect |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **BIS** | Becomes regulatory hub | Basel Accords standardize global banking |
| **IMF** | Becomes structural adjustment enforcer | Washington Consensus imposed on debtors |
| **Federal Reserve** | Becomes global lender of last resort | Dollar swap lines, crisis management |
| **GATT → WTO** | 1995 | Binding dispute resolution; deeper liberalization |

---

### Consolidation (1991-2008)

**"End of History":** Soviet collapse removes alternative. Full globalization.

**The think tank / forum layer:**

| Institution | Founded | Function | Key Figures |
|-------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)** | 1921 | Bipartisan foreign policy consensus | David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger |
| **Trilateral Commission** | 1973 | US-Europe-Japan elite coordination | David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski |
| **World Economic Forum (WEF)** | 1971 | Davos: public-private partnership ideology | Klaus Schwab |
| **Brookings Institution** | 1916 | Centrist policy development | Cross-board with CFR, Trilateral |
| **Atlantic Council** | 1961 | NATO/transatlantic coordination | Defense/foreign policy establishment |
| **CSIS** | 1962 | Strategic studies | Bipartisan security establishment |

**The interlocking directorate:** These institutions share boards, funders, and personnel. CFR chairman David Rubenstein is also Brookings co-chair. Trilateral North American chair Meghan O'Sullivan sits on CFR board. The "revolving door" between government, finance, and think tanks creates a unified policy class.

**Cross-party consensus:** The arrangement is explicitly bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans differ on domestic policy but converge on:
- Free trade agreements (NAFTA, WTO, TPP)
- Central bank independence
- Financial deregulation
- Military interventionism to enforce "rules-based order"
- IMF/World Bank structural adjustment

---

### Crisis and Adaptation (2008-present)

**2008 Financial Crisis:** The arrangement nearly collapses but is rescued by:
- Federal Reserve emergency lending (trillions)
- BIS-coordinated central bank swap lines
- G20 coordination (expanding beyond G7)
- Quantitative easing as permanent policy

**New tensions:**
- China's rise outside the arrangement's rules
- Brexit, Trump — nationalist reaction within the West
- COVID response → "Great Reset" proposal
- Inflation return → stress on central bank credibility

**The "Great Reset" (2020):**

Klaus Schwab's proposal to use COVID crisis for:
- "Stakeholder capitalism" replacing shareholder capitalism
- Public-private partnership (corporations as governance actors)
- ESG/sustainability as condition of capital access
- Digital transformation accelerated

**Criticism from left:** Naomi Klein called it "coronavirus-themed rebranding" — the rich appearing to reform while preserving their position.

**Criticism from right:** An attempt to impose global governance, bypassing national sovereignty.

**Criticism from both:** The Transnational Institute describes Davos as "a silent global coup d'état" where corporations become official stakeholders while governments become one stakeholder among many.

**BIS role:**
- Hosts central bank governors' meetings (Economic Consultative Committee, Global Economy Meeting)

- Sets capital standards (Basel I, II, III)
- Coordinates monetary policy informally
- Described as where "a self-selected group of decision-makers shape global economic policy"

**Federal Reserve role:**
- Dollar as reserve currency gives US monetary policy global effect
- Swap lines to other central banks in crisis
- Lender of last resort for global dollar system
- "Independence" from Congress but coordination with other central banks
- Bernanke: "Globalization influences the conduct of monetary policy through its powerful effects on the economic and financial environment"

**The consensus production mechanism:**

1. **Elite forums** (Davos, Trilateral, Bilderberg) convene business, government, media leaders
2. **Think tanks** (CFR, Brookings, CSIS) produce policy papers staffed by former officials
3. **Media** (major outlets often have CFR members on boards/staff) amplifies consensus positions
4. **Government** (officials rotate through think tanks) implements
5. **Academia** (funded research, recruited experts) legitimates

**Goldwater's critique:** "A skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power: political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical."

## The Diagnostic Contrast

### Oikonomic/Chrematistic

| Question | American System | Globalist Arrangement |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **What are the limits?** | National sufficiency for independence | None — growth is infinite imperative |
| **What is the telos?** | National productive capacity, security | "Growth," "development," shareholder returns |
| **Who is the household?** | The nation | No household — global economy as abstraction |
| **What counts as enough?** | Industrial parity with competitors | Never enough — accumulation without limit |

**Verdict:**
- American System: **Oikonomic** — the nation is the oikos; bounded by sufficiency
- Globalist Arrangement: **Chrematistic** — unbounded accumulation; no limit principle; "the economy" serves no household

---

### Developmental/Extractive

| Question | American System | Globalist Arrangement |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Builds productive capacity?** | Yes — explicit purpose | Ambiguous — builds some, extracts from others |
| **Who develops?** | The nation as whole | Capital-owners; some nations at expense of others |
| **Time horizon?** | Generational | Quarterly (shareholder); electoral (politicians) |
| **Infant industry logic?** | Core principle | Prohibited by WTO rules |

**Verdict:**
- American System: **Developmental** for the nation
- Globalist Arrangement: **Extractive** in practice — developing nations locked into commodity export; deindustrialization of former industrial nations; wealth concentration at top

---

### Embedded/Disembedded

| Question | American System | Globalist Arrangement |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Economy subordinate to society?** | Yes — economy serves national development | No — society must adapt to economy |
| **Are labor/land/money protected?** | Partially — tariffs protect labor | No — full commodity fiction; mobile capital disciplines labor |
| **What violence created this?** | Revolution; Civil War | Structural adjustment; regime change; debt discipline |

**Verdict:**
- American System: **Embedded** in national purpose (though still capitalist)
- Globalist Arrangement: **Disembedded** — the economy is autonomous; Polanyi's "self-regulating market" as ideology

---

### Particular/Universal

| Question | American System | Globalist Arrangement |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Serves specific development?** | Yes — explicitly American | Claims universality but serves specific interests |
| **Conditions acknowledged?** | Yes — American circumstances | No — one model for all ("Washington Consensus") |
| **Role of the state?** | Active developmental agent | Rule-enforcer; "getting out of the way" |

**Verdict:**
- American System: **Particular** — explicitly for American development
- Globalist Arrangement: **Pseudo-universal** — claims to be for everyone but serves capital; List's "cosmopolitan economics" as ideology

---

## The Inversion

The deepest point: **The United States built its industrial supremacy using the American System, then inverted to preach free trade once dominant.**

| Phase | US Position | For Whom |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1791-1945 | Protection, developmental nationalism | American development |
| 1945-present | Free trade, globalization | American hegemony (initially); capital (eventually) |

This is exactly what Britain did:
- Industrialized behind Navigation Acts and tariffs (1600s-1840s)
- Preached free trade after achieving dominance (1846 repeal of Corn Laws)
- List called it "kicking away the ladder"

The United States repeated the pattern. The American System built American industry. Then, dominant, America kicked away the ladder — telling other nations to liberalize while the US had not done so at their stage.

**The irony:** Contemporary Americans who defend "free trade" as traditional are actually defending the **British** tradition that the American System was built to oppose. The Founders — Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln — were protectionists.

---

## The Personnel

### American System Lineage

| Figure | Role | Period |
|--------|------|--------|
| Alexander Hamilton | Founder | 1789-1804 |
| Henry Clay | Systematizer | 1810s-1852 |
| Abraham Lincoln | Implementer | 1861-1865 |
| Friedrich List | Theorist | 1825-1846 |
| Henry Carey | Economist | 1840s-1870s |

### Globalist Arrangement Lineage

| Figure | Role | Institutions |
|--------|------|--------------|
| John Maynard Keynes | Bretton Woods architect | British Treasury |
| Harry Dexter White | Bretton Woods architect | US Treasury |
| David Rockefeller | Network builder | CFR, Trilateral, Chase Manhattan |
| Henry Kissinger | Strategist | CFR, Nixon/Ford administrations |
| Paul Volcker | Central banker | Fed, Trilateral founder |
| Alan Greenspan | Central banker | Fed, Trilateral founder |
| Klaus Schwab | Forum builder | WEF |
| Robert Rubin | Treasury, finance | Goldman Sachs, Treasury, Citigroup, CFR |
| Larry Summers | Treasury, academia | Treasury, Harvard, World Bank |

**The revolving door:**
- Government → think tank → finance → government
- CFR members in every administration since founding
- Fed chairs often from or to Trilateral Commission
- Treasury secretaries often from or to Goldman Sachs

---

## What Each Makes Thinkable

### American System Enables

- The nation as legitimate economic unit
- Protection as developmental tool
- The state as positive agent
- Generational time horizons
- National interest as real category
- Productive capacity over financial returns
- "Enough" as meaningful concept

### Globalist Arrangement Enables

- "The economy" as autonomous sphere
- Capital mobility as freedom
- Central bank "independence" (from democracy, not from capital)
- "Efficiency" as supreme value
- Shareholder returns as purpose
- "Growth" without asking "for whom?"
- Governance by experts insulated from publics

### What Each Suppresses

**American System suppresses:**
- Cosmopolitan solidarity
- Consumer benefit from cheap imports
- International labor solidarity
- Global environmental coordination

**Globalist Arrangement suppresses:**
- National sovereignty in economic policy
- Democratic control of monetary policy
- Infant industry development for late-comers
- Any limit principle on accumulation
- The question "whose interests?"
- The history of how rich nations got rich

## For Etymon Production

### Video Potential

| Title | Hook | Core Content |
|-------|------|--------------|
| "The Ladder They Kicked Away" | "America preaches free trade — after building its industry behind tariffs" | Hamilton → Lincoln → Bretton Woods → WTO |
| "The Central Bank of Central Banks" | "There's a bank in Switzerland that coordinates all the others" | BIS structure and function |
| "Davos Man vs. Hamilton's Vision" | "Two models for who the economy serves" | American System vs. WEF stakeholder capitalism |
| "Who Runs the Rules-Based Order?" | "The think tanks that shape bipartisan consensus" | CFR, Trilateral, personnel overlap |
| "Why Can't We Have Industrial Policy?" | "The rules we wrote for others now bind us" | WTO, IMF constraints on developmental nationalism |

### The Stakes

The contrast reveals: the globalist arrangement is not neutral, natural, or inevitable. It is a specific historical construction, serving specific interests, justified by a specific ideology (cosmopolitan economics) that the American Founders rejected.

Recovery of the American System tradition does not mean autarky or isolation. It means:
- The nation as legitimate unit of economic policy
- Protection appropriate at certain developmental stages
- The state as developmental agent, not just rule-enforcer
- Democratic accountability for monetary policy
- "Enough" as meaningful economic concept
- Who benefits? as legitimate question
