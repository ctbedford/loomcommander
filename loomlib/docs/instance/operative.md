# OPERATIVE

**Type:** Instance
**Frameworks:** Etymon Method
**Output:** Etymon
**Status:** Incubating

## OPERATIVE AS One Who Works the Work

The operator: **AS** — recovers original sense

---

## Excavation

Latin *operari* — to work, to labor, to be busy with
From *opus* (genitive *operis*) — work, labor, but specifically: a work, a production, an opus

*Opus* is not *labor* (toil) and not *ponos* (suffering). Opus is the work that produces a *work*. An opus. The operative is the one who produces through working.

Related: *opera* (work, effort, but also the collaborative artwork), *operation*, *cooperate*

## Drift

**One who works → Merely functional**

1. **Operative (noun):** The one who operates, who works the mechanism, who produces
2. **Operative (adj.):** In operation, functioning, running
3. **Operational:** Merely working, merely running
4. **"The system is operative":** No agent, just status

The agent disappeared. "Operative" now means functional, running, in effect — passive. The worker became an adjective.

---

## The Displacement

When we say "operative capacity," we usually mean "ability to function." But the original sense is stronger: **the one working the work**. Not capacity abstractly, but actively producing.

"Operative capacity in Northwest Arkansas" doesn't mean *potential* to do things. It means *actual operation* — being the one who works, who produces, who makes things go.

---

## The Connection to CAPITAL

Capital without the head that operates it is exactly the drift. The faceless fund "seeks returns" — but funds don't seek. Someone operates the fund.

The operative puts the *caput* back. If capital needs a head (a decider, a risk-bearer, a responsible party), it also needs hands — someone doing the *opus*.

---

## Recovery

What would operative capacity mean, recovered?

- **Not potential but actual:** You're not building capacity to operate someday. You're operating.
- **The agent present:** When you say "operative," there's a who. Someone is working the work.
- **Production, not maintenance:** Operative isn't just "keeping things running." It's making the opus.

## The Diagnostic

The curriculum's diagnostic pattern: upper-left strong (conceptual, meaning, meta, propositional), lower-right weak (material, substance, instance, participatory).

OPERATIVE anchors the lower-right. It's the word for *actually doing the thing*. Recovering it means closing the gap between frameworks and operation.

---

## The Compression

**OPERATIVE:** From one who works the work to merely functional. The agent disappeared into adjective. Recovery means putting the worker back — not potential capacity, but actual operation. The one who produces the opus.
