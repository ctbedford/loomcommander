# Recon: Skill Gaps for Commitments

**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Purpose:** Map what domains need reconnaissance given stated commitments and current operative projects.

---

## The Commitment Structure

From `idx-user-commitments`, the operative commitments cluster into:

| Domain | Core Commitments | Current Projects |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Political Economy** | List, Hamilton, American System, oikonomia | Etymon curriculum (economic genealogy track) |
| **Traditionalism** | Guénon, Evola engaged; hierarchy, anti-universalism | Unresolved: which axis (Christian/perennialist/pagan)? |
| **Lineage** | Cavalier heritage, Bedfordsonian synthesis, particularity | Personal identity, not external production |
| **Psychology** | Jung, KWML, Magician-Warrior imbalance | Developmental edge: shipping vs. abstraction |
| **Methodology** | Etymon Method, AI as instrument, production over capture | Loomlib as tool, Etymon Episode 1 as test |

**The Curriculum (stated):**
1. Philosophical genealogy — *complete* (Vervaeke, meaning crisis)
2. Linguistic recovery — *in progress* (Etymon Method)
3. Economic genealogy — *next* (List, Graeber, institutions)
4. Legal grammar — *parallel* (drafting, interpreting, binding)

---

## Current Graph State

| Perspective | Doc Count | Status |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Philosophical genealogy | 16 | Most mature, verified frameworks |
| Linguistic recovery | 10 | Active, Etymon Method verified |
| Economic genealogy | 15 | Active recon in progress |
| Legal grammar | 0 | Not started |

| Output Channel | Doc Count | Status |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Etymon | 35 | Content awaiting capture |
| Loomcommander | 37 | Tool documentation |

## Recon Priority Analysis

### 1. LEGAL GRAMMAR — Critical Gap

**Status:** Zero documents. Not even a note.

**Why it matters:**
- The Cavalier heritage includes "first sheriff" (Stephen Bedford) — law as institution-building
- Stated commitment: "Legal grammar will give: drafting and interpreting, salience for what binds and enforces"
- The political economy commitments (protection of infant industries, developmental state) require understanding legal instruments
- "Joining the system when the moment is germane" requires knowing what systems bind

**Recon needed:**
- What is the terrain of legal grammar as a discipline?
- What sources? (Blackstone? Hart? American constitutional tradition?)
- What skills? (Contract drafting? Statutory interpretation? Property law?)
- What's the overlap with economic genealogy (corporate law, financial instruments)?

**Priority:** HIGH — this is a missing curriculum track

---

### 2. TRADITIONAL AUTHORITY AXIS — Unresolved Question

**Status:** Guénon/Evola "engaged, not committed." Christian question unresolved.

**Why it matters:**
- `idx-user-commitments` explicitly flags: "Where do you land on the Christian vs. perennialist vs. pagan-sympathetic axis?"
- The Cavalier heritage is Anglican
- Peterson is "vaguely Christian-archetypal"
- The traditionalists split here
- This determines peer selection and telos

**Recon needed:**
- What does the Anglican tradition actually offer? (Not as liberal Protestantism but as specific form)
- What's the Cavalier religious posture? (Research: Virginia Anglicanism, not New England Puritanism)
- Where does Evola's critique of Christianity land for someone in your position?
- Is there a "third way" that isn't syncretist?

**Priority:** HIGH — blocking question for identity

---

### 3. VIDEO PRODUCTION — Operative Skill Gap

**Status:** Etymon Episode 1 not shipped. 35 docs in Etymon channel awaiting capture.

**Why it matters:**
- "The Magician-Warrior imbalance is the live challenge. Framework proliferation without shipping is the symptom."
- "Etymon Episode 1 is the test."
- The apologetic on Four Knowings just produced is Etymon content — but not shipped.

**Recon needed:**
- What does the video production workflow actually require? (Technical: editing, audio, graphics)
- What's blocking? Is it technical skill or Magician resistance to finishing?
- Who are models for the format you want? (Not to imitate but to understand)
- What's the minimum viable episode?

**Priority:** CRITICAL — this is the Warrior test

---

### 4. CONTEMPORARY PEERS — Who Else?

**Status:** Question flagged in commitments: "Who are your actual contemporary peers?"

**Why it matters:**
- Teachers (Peterson, Vervaeke) are not peers
- Historical figures (List, Guénon) are authorities
- The question is: who alive now shares enough commitments to learn from/with?
- This affects what you read, who you engage, what conversations you join

**Recon needed:**
- American Affairs orbit — who specifically?
- IM1776 / post-liberal space — who's serious vs. performance?
- The Straussians — relevant or different tradition?
- Tech + traditionalism overlap — who's building, not just writing?

**Priority:** MEDIUM — orientation, not blocking

---

### 5. BEESAFE / CIVITAS — Business Domain

**Status:** Active 90-day validation sprint. PathX is built context.

**Why it matters:**
- This is Warrior territory — concrete business, customer validation, shipping
- Success/failure here tests the Magician-Warrior integration
- Political economy commitments (developmental nationalism, productive capacity) are abstract until instantiated in actual building

**Recon needed:**
- What does the security robot market actually look like?
- Who are the customers (HOAs, municipalities)?
- What's the regulatory terrain?
- Is this developmental nationalism instantiated or just business?

**Priority:** OPERATIVE — this is happening now, recon should serve action

---

## Recommended Recon Sequence

Based on analysis:

### Immediate (serves current action)

| Recon | Reason | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Video Production Workflow** | Unblocks Etymon Episode 1 | Checklist, MVE definition |
| **BeeSafe Market** | Serves 90-day sprint | Customer profiles, regulatory map |

### Foundational (fills curriculum gaps)

| Recon | Reason | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Legal Grammar Domain** | Missing curriculum track | Source list, skill taxonomy, connection to economic genealogy |
| **Virginia Anglicanism** | Resolves authority axis question | Historical research, position paper |

### Developmental (identity and peer questions)

| Recon | Reason | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Contemporary Peer Mapping** | Orients engagement | Peer list with commitment analysis |

---

## Anti-Recons (Don't Start)

| Domain | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| **More Vervaeke analysis** | Already have enough; risk of Magician trap |
| **More framework building** | 14 frameworks exist; ship instances instead |
| **More economic genealogy excavation** | Recon in progress; finish before expanding |
| **Abstract methodology** | Loomlib works; don't redesign, use |

---

## The Warrior Test

The meta-recon reveals: you don't lack knowledge domains to explore. You lack *capture* — the conversion of research into shipped artifacts.

**The honest assessment:**
- 35 Etymon docs exist. Zero videos exist.
- The Magician-Warrior imbalance is diagnosed. The treatment is shipping, not more diagnosis.
- Every additional recon that doesn't directly serve Episode 1 or BeeSafe is Magician activity.

**What this recon enables:**
- Permission to do the Video Production Workflow recon (it's operative, not abstractive)
- Permission to skip the Legal Grammar recon *for now* (it's foundational but not blocking)
- Permission to treat "more research" as the thing to resist

---

## Composition

**Upstream:**
- `fw-recon-method` — method
- `idx-user-commitments` — the calibration source

**Downstream potential:**
- `inst-recon-video-production` — if video workflow recon is executed
- `inst-recon-legal-grammar` — when curriculum gap is addressed
- `inst-recon-virginia-anglicanism` — when authority axis is addressed
