# Credo IV: Epistemology — How Do We Know?

**The Question:** What counts as knowledge? How do we access truth?

**Status:** ◐ Strong
**Action Required:** State authority structure

---

## The Commitment (MOSTLY ARTICULATED)

What is already held:

> Four kinds of knowing: propositional, procedural, perspectival, participatory. Modernity over-indexes on propositional; I seek participatory. Encounter is a valid mode of knowledge — my conversion experience proves this to me. Genealogical thinking structures inquiry. Philological excavation reveals what surfaces conceal. I believe in gnosis — knowledge that transforms the knower.

What remains to state:

> When reason and revelation conflict, which wins? When my excavation contradicts Church teaching, what do I do? What is the authority structure?

---

## The Strong Positions

### The Four Knowings (from Vervaeke)

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Propositional** | Knowing that | "The capital of France is Paris" |
| **Procedural** | Knowing how | Riding a bicycle |
| **Perspectival** | Knowing what it's like | Being in love |
| **Participatory** | Knowing by becoming | Wisdom, transformation |

**The Diagnosis:**
- Modernity over-indexes on propositional knowing
- This causes the "meaning crisis" — we know facts but lack wisdom
- Recovery requires all four kinds, with participatory as integrating

**Your Position:**
- This framework is adopted, not just acknowledged
- Participatory knowing is the goal — not just information but transformation
- The LSD conversion was participatory knowing — you became different

### Encounter as Knowledge

Your conversion account:
> "I recognized I believed in an ontological evil... I felt the power and the moment... I have to be on the side of good and submit that Christ is my Lord and savior."

This was not argument. It was encounter. And encounter produced knowledge:
- Knowledge of ontological evil (by experience)
- Knowledge of ontological good (by inference from encounter)
- Knowledge of Christ as the good (by participatory identification)

**Implication:** Encounter is a valid epistemic mode. Experience can produce knowledge that argument cannot reach.

### Genealogical Thinking

From Vervaeke and your own practice:
- "How did we get here?" structures inquiry
- Understanding requires tracing development
- Current confusion often comes from forgotten origins
- Recovery requires excavation of history

This grounds the Etymon Method — etymology as archaeology.

### Philological Excavation

From your original work:
- Terms carry operational capacity from their origins
- Modern usage often degrades original meaning
- Etymology reveals what surfaces conceal
- Recovery is for application, not nostalgia

This is a method of knowing — not just propositional knowledge about words, but participatory recovery of lost capacity.

### Gnosis

You believe in gnosis:
- Knowledge that transforms the knower
- Not just information but initiation
- Some truths are accessible only through transformation
- You must be changed to perceive them

This is risky — gnosis can become Gnosticism. But you affirm it.

## The Tension: Authority Structure

### The Question

When different sources of knowledge conflict, which wins?

**The Possible Conflicts:**

| Source A | Source B | Question |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Reason | Revelation | Does philosophy override Scripture? |
| Experience | Tradition | Does my encounter override the Church's teaching? |
| Excavation | Doctrine | If etymology reveals something the Church hasn't taught, what then? |
| Participatory | Propositional | If what I know by becoming conflicts with what I know by argument? |

### The Options

#### Option A: Reason Supreme

- Revelation must accord with reason to be accepted
- Experience is filtered through rational critique
- The Enlightenment position

*Why Rejected:* You've experienced things reason cannot ground. The encounter was real. Reason alone is insufficient.

#### Option B: Revelation Supreme

- Scripture and Tradition are the final authority
- Experience and reason are subordinate
- If my experience contradicts Church teaching, my experience is in error

*Why Attractive:* This is the traditional Christian position. It guards against private illumination.

*Why Problematic:* Which revelation? (Ecclesiology unresolved.) What about valid experiences that the Church hasn't processed?

#### Option C: Experience Supreme

- My encounter is my ultimate authority
- Tradition and reason are filtered through experience
- Private gnosis trumps public doctrine

*Why Dangerous:* This is the road to heresy, delusion, and solipsism. The Gnostics took this path.

#### Option D: Integration Under Tradition

- Tradition provides the framework
- Experience, reason, excavation operate within that framework
- When they conflict with tradition, tradition has presumptive authority
- But tradition can be reformed by sufficient weight of experience and reason

*This seems closest to your operative position.* You investigate within Christian tradition. But you also excavate, which can challenge received understanding.

### The Specific Question

If your philological excavation reveals that a term has been misunderstood — and the Church has taught based on that misunderstanding — what do you do?

**Possible Answers:**

1. **Submit to Church teaching** — Your excavation is probably wrong, or the Church has reasons you don't see.

2. **Propose correction humbly** — Excavation can refine understanding; the Church can learn.

3. **Distinguish levels** — Dogma is non-negotiable; theological opinion is open to revision; pastoral practice can change.

4. **Await resolution** — Hold the tension; time will reveal which is right.

## The Confession Required

To move from ◐ to ◉, you must state:

### On the Four Knowings

```
I believe all four modes of knowing are valid: propositional, procedural, perspectival, participatory.
Participatory knowing is [supreme/integrating/one among equals].
Modernity's problem is [over-indexing on propositional/other diagnosis].
```

### On Encounter and Gnosis

```
I believe encounter produces genuine knowledge.
Gnosis — transformative knowledge — is [real and valuable/dangerous and suspect/both].
The risk of private illumination is managed by [submission to tradition/communal discernment/other].
```

### On Authority Structure

```
When reason and revelation conflict, [revelation wins/reason wins/we seek integration/other].
When experience and tradition conflict, [tradition has presumptive authority/experience can override/we hold tension/other].
When excavation reveals something the Church hasn't taught, I [submit/propose humbly/distinguish levels/other].
```

## The Test

When this document moves from ◐ to ◉, it will contain:

> "I believe knowledge comes through [sources]. When these conflict, [authority structure]. This commits me to [implications for how I handle disagreement with received teaching]."

The authority question must be answered.
