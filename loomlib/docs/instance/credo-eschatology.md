# Credo IX: Eschatology — What Is the End?

**The Question:** What is the final state? What happens after death, after history?

**Status:** ○ Implicit
**Action Required:** Articulate explicitly

---

## The Commitment (NOT YET ARTICULATED)

What is implied by confessing Christ:
- Resurrection of the body
- Judgment
- Heaven and hell
- New creation

What is not yet articulated:
- What do you actually believe happens after death?
- What is heaven? What is hell? States, places, both?
- What is the resurrection of the body — continuity of this body, or something else?
- What is the new creation — restoration of Eden, or something genuinely new?

---

## The Implied Positions

### From Christ Confession

If Christ rose bodily, and you confess Him:
- Death is not the end
- Resurrection is bodily (Christ's tomb was empty)
- Judgment follows death ("it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment" — Hebrews 9:27)
- Christ's resurrection is the guarantee of ours

### From Christian Tradition

The creeds confess:
- "I believe in the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting" (Apostles' Creed)
- "I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come" (Nicene Creed)

This is not optional Christian belief — it is creedal.

## The Questions Requiring Articulation

### What Happens at Death?

**The Options:**

1. **Soul sleep** — The soul "sleeps" until the resurrection
   - No conscious experience between death and resurrection
   - Protestant position (some)

2. **Immediate conscious existence** — The soul goes immediately to heaven or hell
   - "Today you will be with me in Paradise" (Luke 23:43)
   - Catholic/Orthodox position
   - But this is intermediate state, not final

3. **Particular judgment** — Each soul is judged at death
   - Determines intermediate state (heaven, hell, or purgatory)
   - Catholic position includes purgatory
   - Orthodox is less defined

**Your Position?** This requires articulation.

### What Is Heaven?

**The Options:**

1. **Place** — A location where the blessed go
   - "Many mansions" (John 14:2)
   - Spatialized conception

2. **State** — A condition of being with God
   - "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8)
   - The beatific vision is the content of heaven

3. **Both** — A place that is also a state
   - The New Jerusalem (Revelation 21)
   - Heaven comes to earth — a renewed creation

**The Orthodox Position:**
- Theosis continues after death
- Heaven is increasing participation in God's life
- Not static bliss but dynamic growth

**Your Position?** This requires articulation.

### What Is Hell?

**The Options:**

1. **Eternal conscious torment** — The damned suffer forever
   - "Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels" (Matthew 25:41)
   - Traditional position

2. **Annihilationism** — The damned cease to exist
   - "The wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23)
   - Destruction, not torment

3. **Universal reconciliation** — Eventually all are saved
   - "God may be all in all" (1 Corinthians 15:28)
   - Origen, Gregory of Nyssa (some readings)

4. **Hell as self-chosen separation** — Hell is the refusal of God
   - C.S. Lewis: "The doors of hell are locked from the inside"
   - Not punishment imposed but consequence chosen

**The Orthodox Position:**
- Hell is experiencing God's love as fire
- The same divine presence is heaven to the blessed and hell to the damned
- Emphasis on mystery and restraint in speculation

**Your Position?** This requires articulation.

### What Is the Resurrection of the Body?

**The Questions:**

1. **Continuity** — Is the resurrection body the same body or a new one?
   - Paul: "It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body" (1 Corinthians 15:44)
   - Christ was recognizable but also different (walked through walls, not always recognized)

2. **Material** — Is the resurrection body made of atoms or something else?
   - Thomistic: The same matter, perfected
   - Some: Different "matter" — spiritual body

3. **Identity** — What makes the resurrection body "you"?
   - Soul continuity?
   - Pattern continuity?
   - Divine decree?

**Your Position?** This requires articulation.

### What Is the New Creation?

**The Options:**

1. **Restoration** — Return to Eden
   - The fall undone
   - Paradise restored

2. **Transformation** — Something genuinely new
   - "Behold, I make all things new" (Revelation 21:5)
   - Not return but advance

3. **Both** — Restoration and transformation
   - The original good, plus the journey through history
   - Nothing is lost; all is transfigured

**Your Position?** This requires articulation.

## The Traditionalist Alternative

Guénon and Evola offer different eschatology:

| Christian | Traditionalist |
|-----------|----------------|
| Linear consummation | Cyclical return |
| Resurrection of body | Liberation from body |
| Individual survives | Individual dissolves into Absolute |
| New creation | New cycle or dissolution |

**The Question:**
If you confess Christ, you cannot hold Traditionalist eschatology without tension. Do you?

---

## The Confession Required

To move from ○ to ◉, you must state:

### On Death

```
I believe at death [what happens — soul sleep/immediate conscious state/particular judgment].
```

### On Heaven

```
I believe heaven is [place/state/both/the beatific vision/theosis continuing/other].
```

### On Hell

```
I believe hell is [eternal conscious torment/annihilation/eventual reconciliation/self-chosen separation/other].
```

### On Resurrection

```
I believe the resurrection of the body means [continuity of this body/spiritual body/pattern preserved/other].
```

### On New Creation

```
I believe the new creation is [restoration of Eden/transformation/both/other].
```
