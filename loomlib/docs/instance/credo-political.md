# Credo VI: Political Philosophy — What Is Legitimate Order?

**The Question:** What is the nature of political authority? What makes it legitimate?

**Status:** ◐ Articulated, in tension
**Action Required:** State source of authority

---

## The Commitment (PARTIALLY ARTICULATED)

What is already owned:

> Liberalism is exhausted — it cannot reproduce its own conditions. The post-liberal turn is already operative. Authority must recognize something above itself. Hierarchy is natural and just.

What remains unresolved:

> Where does authority come from? If not consent (liberal), if not blood (fascist), if not confession (integralist), then what?

---

## The Strong Positions

### Liberalism is Exhausted

| Diagnosis | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Cannot reproduce its conditions | Requires pre-liberal virtues it cannot generate |
| Neutrality is impossible | Liberalism privileges itself, calls it neutral |
| Proceduralism is hollow | "Right process" without substantive good leads nowhere |
| Atomized individuals fail to form community | Rights-bearing individuals don't make households |
| Markets devour what they depend on | Trust, loyalty, long-term thinking — all consumed |

This is held as conviction, not theory. The diagnosis comes from multiple sources: MacIntyre, Deneen, Lasch, the Traditionalists, and observation.

### Post-Liberal Turn Already Operative

Not "should happen" but "is happening." Liberalism's children no longer believe in it. The question is not whether post-liberalism but which post-liberalism.

### Hierarchy is Natural and Just

| Source | Articulation |
|--------|--------------|
| Traditionalist | Caste-nature, qualitative difference between humans |
| Cavalier | Some are fit to govern, some are not — by breeding, formation, calling |
| Aristotelian | Natural hierarchy in household and polis |
| Christian | Authority from God, mediated through structures |

You affirm hierarchy without specifying its exact ground. This must be specified.

### American Particularity

| Position | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| Not European throne-and-altar | American founding was different |
| Not secular liberal | But not merely procedural neutrality |
| Regional thickness within federal structure | Federalism as structure for particularity |
| Cavalier inheritance operates | Virginia gentry tradition shapes disposition |

## The Tension: Source of Authority

The question is not "where should authority go?" but "where does it originate?"

### The Options

#### Option A: Consent (Liberal)

**The Position:**
- Authority derives from the consent of the governed
- Legitimacy is procedural — proper elections, due process
- No natural hierarchy — all are equal before the law
- Government is a social contract

**Why Rejected:**
- You've diagnosed this as exhausted
- Consent theory cannot ground obligations to future generations
- "All men are created equal" as metaphysical claim, not political procedure
- Consent can authorize anything — including its own dissolution

#### Option B: Divine Right (Monarchist)

**The Position:**
- Authority descends from God through the sovereign
- Legitimacy is sacramental — the king is anointed
- Hierarchy is divinely ordained
- Rebellion is sin

**Why Problematic:**
- No king in America
- The Cavalier inheritance is gentry, not royalist
- Divine right was contested even in Christendom
- How does this work in a republic?

#### Option C: Confession (Integralist)

**The Position:**
- The state should be ordered toward the true religion
- The church has indirect authority over temporal matters
- Legitimacy requires right ordering toward the good
- Religious freedom is error — truth has rights, error does not

**Why Problematic:**
- Which church? (Ecclesiology unresolved)
- American particularity doesn't fit this model
- Integralism has no mechanism in current conditions
- You've said "no confessional state"

#### Option D: Nation (Nationalist)

**The Position:**
- The nation is the natural political unit
- Authority is legitimate when it serves the nation
- Blood and soil ground community
- The state expresses the nation's will

**Why Problematic:**
- "Nation" is contested — which nation? Ethnic? Cultural? Civic?
- Blood-nationalism has obvious problems
- Civic nationalism collapses back into liberalism
- American "nation" is unusual — proposition nation? Settler nation? Anglo nation?

#### Option E: Effective Order (Schmittian)

**The Position:**
- Sovereignty is the capacity to decide the exception
- Legitimacy is effective order, not consent or confession
- The political is friend-enemy distinction
- All politics is ultimately about who decides

**Why Engaged:**
- Descriptively accurate — this is how power works
- Cuts through liberal pretense of neutrality
- Explains why regimes persist

**Why Insufficient:**
- Pure decisionism is nihilistic — might makes right
- No transcendent grounding
- You want authority that recognizes something above itself
- Schmitt diagnoses; he doesn't prescribe

#### Option F: Transcendent Order Mediated Through Tradition (Your Position?)

**The Position:**
- Authority originates in God (transcendent ground)
- But is mediated through tradition, inheritance, formation
- Not through a single anointed sovereign (not monarchism)
- Not through confessional state (not integralism)
- Not through consent (not liberalism)
- Through the accumulated wisdom of particular peoples
- Authority is legitimate when it serves the common good of a particular community, ordered toward transcendent ends

**This would require articulating:**
- How does tradition mediate divine authority?
- What makes one tradition authoritative and another not?
- How does this work in America specifically?
- What is the relationship between federal and regional authority?

## The Lee Kuan Yew Critique

From the constructed dialogue:

> "Neutrality is impossible. If you don't privilege your tradition, you've privileged your enemies'."

This cuts against:
- "Christian pluralism" without confessional state
- Tolerance as the highest value
- Procedural neutrality

If Lee is right, you must choose:
1. Accept integralism (privilege Christianity explicitly)
2. Accept that your "Christian pluralism" is actually crypto-integralism
3. Explain how pluralism works without being captured by your enemies

---

## The Regional Thickness Model

You've articulated:
- "Regional thickness within federal structure"
- American particularity must be respected
- Not European throne-and-altar

**This suggests:**
- Federalism allows different regions to embody different thicknesses
- The federal level is thin (procedural, limited)
- The regional/local level is thick (substantive, particular)
- Northwest Arkansas can be more traditionally ordered than San Francisco
- This requires robust federalism, not consolidated national government

**Problems:**
- Federal government is already consolidated
- How do you get from here to there?
- Does this avoid the authority question or just postpone it?

---

## The Strategic Posture

From `idx-user-commitments`:

> - Phase 1: Destabilize liberal premises from within
> - Phase 2: Make unspeakable first speakable, then thinkable
> - Phase 3: Offer alternative when ready
> - "Establish the canvas on the social easel first"

This is prudent but defers the question. At some point, you must offer the alternative. What is it?

---

## The Confession Required

To move from ◐ to ◉, you must state:

### On the Origin of Authority

```
Authority originates in [God/Nature/Tradition/Other].
It is mediated through [specific mechanism].
This grounds hierarchy because [reason].
```

### On Legitimate vs. Illegitimate Authority

```
Authority is legitimate when [criteria].
Authority becomes illegitimate when [criteria].
The current regime is [legitimate/illegitimate/mixed] because [analysis].
```

### On the American Situation

```
The American founding was [correct/flawed/mixed] in its understanding of authority.
The Cavalier inheritance [does/does not] provide resources for right order.
The path forward involves [specific vision].
```

### On the Relationship to Ecclesiology

```
Political authority relates to church authority by [relationship].
This [is/is not] integralism because [distinction].
```

## Downstream Implications

| If Transcendent Order Through Tradition | Then |
|-----------------------------------------|------|
| Economics | Economy serves tradition-bearing communities |
| Education | Formation in particular tradition, not neutral skills |
| Family | Household as political unit, not just private sphere |
| Local vs. Federal | Subsidiarity — lowest level capable of deciding should decide |

---

## The Test

When this document moves from ◐ to ◉, it will contain:

> "I believe authority originates in _____ and is mediated through _____. This makes hierarchy legitimate because _____. In America, this means _____. This commits me to _____."

The source question must be answered. Not evaded, not deferred — answered.
