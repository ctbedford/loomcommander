# Credo VII: Economics — What Is Wealth For?

**The Question:** What is the purpose of economic activity? What is the right relationship between economy and polity?

**Status:** ◉ Solid
**Action Required:** Resolve List/Distributist tension

---

## The Commitment (ARTICULATED)

What is already held:

> Friedrich List over Ricardo: productive capacity over exchange efficiency. Oikonomia over chrematistics: household flourishing over unlimited accumulation. American System tradition: Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln. Skepticism of financialization. Long time horizons, regional rootedness, human-scale enterprise. Capital deployed for productive power, not financial return.

What remains to resolve:

> How do you handle the tension between List (national-scale industrial policy) and Distributism (small-scale ownership)? At what scale should enterprise operate? How does Bedford capital relate to the broader economy?

---

## The Strong Positions

### Friedrich List over Ricardo

| Ricardo | List |
|---------|------|
| Comparative advantage | Productive capacity |
| Free trade always beneficial | Protection for infant industries |
| Efficiency as goal | National development as goal |
| Static equilibrium | Dynamic growth |
| All nations should specialize | Nations should develop full productive base |

**Your Position:**
- Ricardo's free trade theory serves those already industrialized
- List understood that nations must develop productive capacity before competing
- The American System (Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln) followed List, not Ricardo
- Free trade ideology is a tool of already-dominant powers

### Oikonomia over Chrematistics

From Aristotle (and `fw-oikonomia-chrematistics`):

| Oikonomia | Chrematistics |
|-----------|---------------|
| Household management | Wealth acquisition |
| Natural, bounded | Unnatural, unlimited |
| Wealth for use | Wealth for accumulation |
| Aim: flourishing | Aim: more |

**Your Position:**
- The economy should serve household flourishing
- Unlimited accumulation is a vice, not a goal
- Financialization (money making money) is chrematistics run wild
- Enterprise should be embedded in community, not abstract capital flows

### American System Tradition

| Figure | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| Hamilton | Report on Manufactures — develop national industry |
| Clay | American System — tariffs, internal improvements, national bank |
| Lincoln | Protective tariffs, transcontinental railroad, land-grant colleges |
| List | National System of Political Economy — theory behind the practice |

**Your Position:**
- This is your tradition — not British free trade, not Continental socialism
- American development happened through state action, not laissez-faire
- The tradition was abandoned in the 20th century — first for Cold War alliances, then for neoliberal ideology
- Recovery of this tradition is possible and necessary

### Long Time Horizons

- Short-term profit destroys long-term capacity
- Financialization optimizes for quarterly returns
- Regional rootedness requires multi-generational thinking
- The Bedford inheritance spans 14 generations — that's the time horizon

### Skepticism of Financialization

| Productive Economy | Financialized Economy |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Makes things | Trades claims on things |
| Creates value | Extracts rents |
| Regional, embodied | Global, abstract |
| Long time horizons | Short-term extraction |

**Your Position:**
- Finance should serve production, not the reverse
- FIRE sector (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate) has grown cancerously
- "Capital" now means financial assets, not productive capacity — this is the degradation

## The Tension: List vs. Distributism

### The List Position

- National-scale industrial policy
- The state develops productive capacity
- Tariffs protect infant industries
- Infrastructure investment (internal improvements)
- Big players serve national development

*Implication:* Large-scale enterprise is acceptable if it serves national productive capacity.

### The Distributist Position

- Widespread ownership is the goal
- Both capitalism and socialism concentrate power
- Small property, family enterprise, guild organization
- "Three acres and a cow"
- Human-scale is essential

*Implication:* Large-scale enterprise is dangerous regardless of who controls it.

### The Tension

List implies national champions, coordinated industrial policy, big players.
Distributism implies small players, widespread ownership, local production.

**Can you hold both?**

### Possible Resolution

**Option A: Scale by Sector**

| Sector | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Infrastructure | Large (national) |
| Heavy industry | Large (national champions) |
| Agriculture | Small (family farms) |
| Retail/services | Small (local ownership) |
| Finance | Regulated, serve production |

*Some things require scale; others thrive at human scale.*

**Option B: Subsidiarity**

- What can be done locally, should be done locally
- What requires larger scale, should be regional
- Only what requires national scale should be national
- Large enterprises are tolerable only when necessary

*This is Catholic social teaching applied to economics.*

**Option C: Developmental Nationalism with Distributist Telos**

- Use Listian methods (tariffs, industrial policy) to develop productive capacity
- But aim toward distributed ownership over time
- National champions during development phase
- Break up and distribute once capacity is established

*Germany used cartels to industrialize, then regulated them.*

**Option D: Bedford Capital as Model**

- You cannot change the whole economy
- But you can build according to your principles
- Bedford capital: long time horizons, productive investment, regional rootedness
- Build a protected space within the broader economy
- Demonstrate the alternative rather than advocating for it at scale

*This is Alasdair MacIntyre's "new Benedict option" applied to economics.*

## The Role of the State

| Position | State Role |
|----------|------------|
| Liberal | Minimal — enforce contracts, protect property |
| Listian | Active — develop productive capacity, protect industries |
| Distributist | Shape incentives — favor small property, break up concentrations |
| Your synthesis? | ? |

**The Question:**
- How much state action do you want?
- What kind of state? (National? Regional? Local?)
- How does this relate to your political philosophy (authority, hierarchy)?

---

## Bedford Capital Specifically

How does your capital relate to the broader economy?

**Option A: Change the System**
- Advocate for policy change (Listian industrial policy)
- Political action to shift economic structure
- Long-term project, uncertain success

**Option B: Build Protected Space**
- Invest according to your principles within current system
- Regional, productive, long-term
- Model the alternative
- Don't try to change the system — outcompete it locally

**Option C: Both**
- Build protected space now (practical)
- Advocate for system change over time (strategic)
- Phase 1: Build. Phase 2: Advocate when conditions allow.

## The Confession Required

To move from ◉ to ◉ (solid, fully articulated), you must state:

### On the Purpose of Economy

```
I believe the economy exists to [serve household flourishing/develop productive capacity/both].
Wealth is for [use/accumulation/stewardship/other].
```

### On List vs. Distributism

```
I resolve the List/Distributism tension by [scale by sector/subsidiarity/developmental nationalism with distributist telos/other].
Enterprise should operate at [human scale except when.../national scale for.../other].
```

### On State Role

```
The state should [actively develop productive capacity/shape incentives toward distribution/minimal intervention/other].
This relates to my political philosophy because [connection].
```

### On Bedford Capital

```
Bedford capital relates to the broader economy by [building protected space/advocating system change/both].
The strategy is [specific approach].
```

When this document is complete, it will contain:

> "I believe the economy exists to _____. I resolve the List/Distributism tension by _____. The state should _____. Bedford capital will _____."

This is already the strongest category. Completing it means specifying the tensions.
