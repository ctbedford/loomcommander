# Credo I: Metaphysics — What Is Real?

**The Question:** What is the fundamental structure of reality?

**Status:** ◐ Articulated, scattered
**Action Required:** Consolidate into one paragraph

---

## The Commitment (TO BE CONSOLIDATED)

What is already held (scattered across conversations):

> Reality is hierarchical — material, psychic, spiritual levels. I experienced ontological evil directly and deduced ontological good. The material world is real but not ultimate. Immaterial realities affect the material. I am not a materialist.

What remains to articulate:

> Is reality hierarchical (Traditionalist/Neoplatonic — matter inferior to spirit) or sacramental (Christian — matter infused with spirit, not inferior to it)? Is the material world a prison, a school, or a gift?

---

## The Strong Positions

### Not a Materialist

This is certain. From your encounter:

> "I recognized I believed in an ontological evil, and thus I figured there must be an ontological opposite."

Materialism cannot accommodate this experience. If only matter exists:
- Evil is merely dysfunction, not ontological reality
- Good is merely preference, not ontological opposite
- The encounter was delusion, not revelation

You reject this. The experience was real. Therefore: reality includes more than matter.

### Reality is Hierarchical

Multiple levels exist:
- Material — the physical world accessible to senses
- Psychic — the soul, the realm of archetypes, dreams, imagination
- Spiritual — the transcendent, the divine, the sacred

This is engaged from:
- Traditionalism (Guénon, Evola): explicit hierarchy of levels
- Christianity: creation good but not ultimate, heaven above earth
- Jungian psychology: the unconscious as real, archetypes as structures
- Your own experience: encounter with realities beyond the material

### Immaterial Affects Material

The traffic runs both ways:
- Spiritual realities manifest in material world
- Psychic states affect physical outcomes
- Prayer works (or at least, you act as if it does)
- Evil is not just wrong choices but operative force

## The Tension: Hierarchical vs. Sacramental

### Hierarchical (Traditionalist/Neoplatonic)

**The Position:**
- Higher levels are more real than lower
- Spirit is superior to matter
- The goal is ascent — escape from matter to spirit
- The material world is a prison or testing ground
- Modernity's collapse into materialism is the worst possible position

**The Danger:**
- Gnosticism — matter as evil or illusion
- Escape from the world rather than transformation of it
- Contempt for the body, for work, for material life
- Theosis as leaving matter behind

### Sacramental (Christian)

**The Position:**
- Matter is infused with spirit, not inferior to it
- Creation is good — "God saw that it was good"
- The Incarnation sanctified matter — God became flesh
- The goal is not escape but transformation — resurrection of the body
- Sacraments work through material elements (water, bread, wine)

**The Advantage:**
- Honors the material world as gift
- Resurrection is bodily, not escape from body
- Work, family, place are sacred, not obstacles
- Consistent with Incarnation

### The Question

Which do you hold?

If **hierarchical**: The material world is lower, to be transcended. The Traditionalists are right about the structure of reality.

If **sacramental**: The material world is gift, to be sanctified. Matter and spirit interpenetrate. The Incarnation is the paradigm.

**Note:** Orthodoxy may offer a synthesis — theosis includes the body, but hierarchy remains. The distinction may be false dichotomy.

## Bergson's Influence

You've referenced Bergson:
- Duration over clock-time
- Process over static being
- Creative evolution
- Intuition as mode of knowing

This adds:
- Reality is temporal flow, not static structure
- Being is becoming
- Time is real, not illusion

**Integration question:** How does Bergsonian process relate to Traditionalist hierarchy? To Christian sacramentality?

---

## The Confession Required

To move from ◐ to ◉, you must state:

### One Paragraph

```
I believe reality is [hierarchical/sacramental/synthesis].
The material world is [prison/school/gift/other].
Spirit and matter relate by [superiority/interpenetration/other].
I hold this because [grounds — experience, revelation, reasoning].
This commits me to [downstream implications — how I treat body, work, place].
```

### The Relationship to Theology

If sacramental → Incarnation is paradigm; matter is sanctified
If hierarchical → Incarnation is condescension; matter is transcended

The metaphysics grounds the theology, or vice versa. They must cohere.

## The Test

When this document moves from ◐ to ◉, it will contain:

> "I believe reality is _____. The material world is _____. Spirit and matter relate by _____. I hold this because _____. This commits me to _____."

The scattered positions must become one paragraph.

## Composition

**This document was informed by:**
- `fw-worldview-architectonic` (method)
- `idx-bedford-credo` (the credo index)
- The ontological encounter (evil → good)
- Traditionalist sources (Guénon, Evola)
- Bergson

**This document enables:**
- `inst-credo-theology` (metaphysics grounds theology)
- `inst-credo-anthropology` (what is man depends on what is real)
- `inst-credo-epistemology` (what counts as knowledge depends on what exists)
