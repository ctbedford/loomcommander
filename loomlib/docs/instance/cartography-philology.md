# CARTOGRAPHY OF PHILOLOGY

**Type:** Instance
**Frameworks:** Etymon Method
**Output:** Etymon
**Status:** Verified

## The Meta-Video

The operator: **OF** — the method applied to itself

## Excavation

*Philology:* Greek *philos* (loving) + *logos* (word, speech, reason). The love of words. The love of *logos*.

Not linguistics (the science of language). Not literary criticism (the interpretation of texts). Philology was a mode of attention — loving attention to texts, to words, to what language carries.

*Cartography:* Greek *khartēs* (papyrus leaf, map) + *graphein* (to write). The writing of maps.

Cartography of philology: mapping the territory of loving attention to words.

## The Method as Territory

The Etymon project is itself a philological act. Each video performs what it describes:
- **Excavation:** Digging to the root
- **Drift:** Tracing the degradation
- **Recovery:** Asking what capacity was lost

This video maps that method. It's the legend that makes the other maps readable.

## What Philology Notices

The philologist attends to:
- **Etymology:** Where did this word come from?
- **Semantic drift:** How has meaning changed?
- **Connotation loss:** What associations have faded?
- **Operational decay:** What could you *do* with this word that you can't do now?
- **False friends:** Words that look the same but mean different things across time

## The Cadre Question

Who is philological work for?

The "cadre" — post-tribal, action-oriented, 25-40, seeking frameworks not team membership. People who want to *see* better, not just know more. Who suspect that degraded language is part of why things feel stuck.

Philology gives them diagnostic tools. When someone says "context," you hear "weaving." When they say "capital," you hear "cattle." The excavations change what you notice.

## Deployment

This video orients viewers to the channel:
1. What philology is (loving attention to words)
2. What the method is (excavation → drift → recovery)
3. What the operators do (structure the excavations)
4. What the payoff is (transformed seeing, not just knowledge)
5. How to use the videos (diagnostic tools, not trivia)

## The Compression

**CARTOGRAPHY OF PHILOLOGY:** The map of the method. Philology as loving attention to words, not mere word-science. The Etymon project performs what it describes — each excavation is a philological act. This video tells you how to read the other maps.
