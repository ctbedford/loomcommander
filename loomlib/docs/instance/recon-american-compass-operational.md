# Recon: American Compass Operational Understanding

**Date initiated:** 2025-01-09
**Domain:** American Compass — what they articulate, propose, and how they operate
**Intent:** Understand American Compass operationally to assess alignment and inform action
**Scope:**
- Included: Mission, theory, specific policies, institutional form, political positioning, criticisms
- Excluded: Detailed biographical info, funding sources, internal organization

---

## What American Compass Is

**Founded:** 2020 by Oren Cass
**Type:** Conservative think tank (501c3)
**Location:** Washington, D.C.
**Self-description:** "Restore an economic consensus that emphasizes the importance of family, community, and industry to the nation's liberty and prosperity"

**Key claim:** They explicitly invoke Henry Clay's "American System" as their model — developmental nationalism, protectionism, pro-worker policies.

---

## The Core Articulation

### What They Reject

| Orthodoxy | Their Critique |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Free trade** | Hollowed out American manufacturing; serves capital, not workers |
| **Free markets as end** | Markets are means, not ends; must be judged by outcomes for families and communities |
| **Financialization** | Wall Street extracts value rather than creating it; talent drain from productive sectors |
| **GDP as metric** | Growth that doesn't reach workers is meaningless |
| **Deregulation as default** | Some regulation protects workers and communities |
| **Consumer welfare standard** | Ignores producers, workers, communities |

### What They Affirm

| Position | Their Argument |
|----------|----------------|
| **Industrial policy** | Government should actively support strategic industries |
| **Tariffs** | Protect domestic production; rebalance trade |
| **Worker power** | Unions and collective bargaining strengthen families and communities |
| **Family support** | Direct cash benefits to working families with children |
| **Vocational education** | Break the college monopoly; fund on-the-job training |
| **National interest** | Economy should serve the nation, not abstract efficiency |

### The Framing

They frame this as **conservative** by appeal to:
- **Mediating institutions** (families, unions, churches) — traditional conservative concern
- **Private ordering** over government dictates — prefer sectoral bargaining to federal regulation
- **Earned prosperity** over redistribution — work requirements, not welfare
- **National interest** — patriotic, not cosmopolitan
- **Henry Clay / Abraham Lincoln** — historical Republican precedent

---

## Specific Policy Proposals

### 1. Trade: Global Tariff + Local Content

| Proposal | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **10% global tariff** | Across-the-board; increases 5% annually until trade balance |
| **Trade deficit trigger** | Tariff rises if deficit persists, falls if it closes |
| **Local content requirements** | Mandate domestic sourcing for critical goods (semiconductors, communications) |

**Rationale:** Make imports less attractive than domestic production. Force trade partners to negotiate.

### 2. Industrial Policy: Development Finance + Consortia

| Proposal | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **Development bank / finance corporation** | Quasi-public entity with government funding; long-term industrial investment |
| **Pre-competitive consortia** | Industry + government matching funds for joint research (German model) |
| **Targeted investment** | If something is strategically important, invest directly rather than wait for high tariffs to work |

**Rationale:** Markets alone won't rebuild industrial capacity against established foreign competition. Need patient capital and coordination.

### 3. Labor: Works Councils + Sectoral Bargaining

| Proposal | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **Works councils** | Formal worker representation within companies; not traditional unions |
| **Board representation** | Workers elect representatives to corporate boards |
| **Sectoral bargaining** | Industry-wide negotiations; reduce firm-by-firm conflict |
| **Portable benefits** | State/local partnerships with labor organizations to administer benefits |
| **Political activity ban** | Unions receiving mandatory dues or government funds cannot do partisan politics |

**Rationale:** Workers need power, but traditional unions are politically captured. Create new forms of worker organization.

**Controversy:** The political activity ban is criticized as union-busting in disguise.

### 4. Family: Cash Benefits for Working Families

| Proposal | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **Family Income Supplemental Credit (FISC)** | Monthly payments to wage-earning families with children |
| **$800/month** | During pregnancy (from 5th month) |
| **$400/month** | Birth to age 6 |
| **$250/month** | Ages 6-18 |
| **20% marriage bonus** | Higher payment for legally married couples |
| **Work requirement** | Only for wage-earning families |

**Rationale:** Support families who are working and raising children. Not welfare — earned benefit.

### 5. Education: Workforce Training Grant

| Proposal | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **$10,000/year per trainee** | Grant to employers for on-the-job training |
| **State matching** | Federal provides half; states match |
| **Alternative to college subsidy** | Redirect public investment from universities to employers |
| **Vocational pathways** | Break the "all roads lead to college" model |

**Rationale:** The US is the only developed country without significant vocational education. Employers train better than colleges for many careers.

### 6. Finance: Transaction Tax + Anti-Financialization

| Proposal | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **Financial transaction tax** | Reduce speculative trading; generate revenue |
| **Debt penalty** | Tax structures that discourage overleveraging |
| **Private equity scrutiny** | Challenge the claim that PE creates value |
| **Antitrust enforcement** | Aggressive action against concentration |

**Rationale:** Finance has metastasized, claiming disproportionate share of talent and profits while actual investment declines.

## The Theoretical Framework

### Core Distinctions

| Their Term | Meaning | Opposite |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Productive markets** | Markets channeled toward national prosperity | Markets as end in themselves |
| **Supportive communities** | Institutions that enable human flourishing | Atomized individuals |
| **Responsive politics** | Measure success by outcomes people value | Measure by GDP/growth |
| **Earned prosperity** | Rewards tied to work and contribution | Redistribution |
| **National interest** | Economy serves the nation | Cosmopolitan efficiency |

### The American System Connection

They explicitly claim the Hamilton-Clay-Lincoln tradition:

| Historical | American Compass Equivalent |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Protective tariffs | Global tariff + local content |
| National bank | Development bank / finance corporation |
| Internal improvements | Infrastructure investment (less emphasized) |
| Infant industry protection | Industrial policy for strategic sectors |
| National productive capacity | Manufacturing-first economics |

### What's Missing from Pure American System

| Gap | Observation |
|-----|-------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Less emphasis than historical American System |
| **Land policy** | No equivalent (frontier exhausted) |
| **Institutional founding** | Policy proposals, not new institutions |
| **Personnel pipeline** | No mechanism for training developmentalists |

---

## Institutional Analysis

### Using Institutionalization Elements Framework

| Element | American Compass Status |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Vision** | Clear: restore manufacturing, support workers and families, national interest |
| **Theory** | Developed: "Rebuilding American Capitalism" handbook, numerous essays |
| **Structure** | Think tank (501c3); no institutions beyond advocacy |
| **Coalition** | Forming: manufacturing interests, some labor, national conservatives, Trump/Vance orbit |
| **Reproduction** | Weak: no training programs, no personnel pipeline beyond DC policy world |

### What They Are

- **Think tank** — produces ideas, papers, policy proposals
- **Advisory board** — includes Robert Lighthizer, Jeff Sessions
- **Project 2025 participant** — contributed to Heritage Foundation project
- **Network hub** — convenes senators (Cotton, Rubio, Vance, Young)

### What They Are Not

- Not a mass movement
- Not creating institutions (beyond themselves)
- Not training operators
- Not building outside DC policy world

---

## Political Positioning

### Allies

| Actor | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| **JD Vance** | Vice President; drew directly from Cass's work; podcast guest |
| **Marco Rubio** | Senator; contributor to "New Conservatives"; speaks at events |
| **Robert Lighthizer** | Trump's USTR; advisory board member |
| **Tom Cotton** | Senator; participates in events |
| **Todd Young** | Senator; participates in events |
| **Heritage Foundation** | Project 2025 collaboration |
| **American Affairs Journal** | Intellectual ally; overlapping network |

### Critics

| Source | Critique |
|--------|----------|
| **Cato Institute** | "Low quality scholarship"; attacks free-market principles |
| **National Taxpayers Union** | "Would wreck American capitalism" |
| **Capital Research Center** | "Blunders left"; adopting European social democracy |
| **RealClearMarkets** | "Childishly attacks private equity" |
| **Left critics (CPUSA, People's World)** | "Pro-worker disguise" for MAGA; union-busting via political activity ban |

### The Political Tension

American Compass occupies contested ground:
- **Too interventionist** for libertarian/free-market right
- **Too conservative** for progressive labor (work requirements, political activity ban, marriage bonus)
- **Aligned with Trump orbit** — draws both support and suspicion

---

## Assessment

### What American Compass Does Well

1. **Theory production** — Articulates a coherent alternative to free-market orthodoxy
2. **Historical grounding** — Connects to American System tradition (Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln)
3. **Specific proposals** — Not just critique; actual policy mechanisms
4. **Political translation** — Makes developmental nationalism palatable to conservatives
5. **Elite access** — Connected to senators, potential appointees, Project 2025

### What American Compass Does Not Do

1. **Institution building** — Produces papers, not standing institutions
2. **Personnel development** — No training programs for developmentalist operators
3. **Popular mobilization** — Elite-focused; no mass movement
4. **Implementation** — Proposes policy; doesn't build capacity to execute
5. **State-level work** — DC-focused; not engaging state experimentation

### The Gap

American Compass fills the **theory** and **coalition** elements of institutionalization but not **structure** or **reproduction**.

| Element | AC Contribution |
|---------|-----------------|
| Vision | ✓ Clear articulation |
| Theory | ✓ "Rebuilding American Capitalism" |
| Structure | ✗ No new institutions proposed |
| Coalition | ✓ Building elite network |
| Reproduction | ✗ No personnel pipeline |

---

## Strategic Categories

### Actors

| Entity | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Oren Cass** | Founder, chief economist | Former Romney advisor; public intellectual |
| **Advisory board** | Legitimation, network | Lighthizer, Sessions, policy experts |
| **Senator network** | Political access | Vance, Rubio, Cotton, Young |
| **American Affairs** | Intellectual ally | Julius Krein; overlapping concerns |
| **Heritage Foundation** | Coalition partner | Project 2025 collaboration |

### Structures

| Structure | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| American Compass (org) | Theory production, policy development |
| "Rebuilding American Capitalism" | Policy handbook |
| Podcast | Dissemination, elite engagement |
| Capitol Hill events | Political networking |
| Project 2025 | Implementation pathway |

### Instruments

| Instrument | Purpose | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Global tariff proposal | Trade rebalancing | Proposed; partially implemented under Trump |
| Development bank concept | Industrial finance | Proposed; not yet legislated |
| FISC (family credit) | Family support | Proposed; not yet legislated |
| Workforce Training Grant | Education reform | Proposed; not yet legislated |
| Works councils concept | Labor reform | Proposed; controversial |

### Dynamics

| Dynamic | Direction | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Trump/Vance alignment | Strengthening | Political access; implementation possible |
| Free-market conservative backlash | Intensifying | Internal GOP conflict |
| Left suspicion | Stable | Limits cross-partisan coalition |
| Industrial policy momentum | Growing | CHIPS Act, IRA normalize intervention |
| Credential reform interest | Growing | Workforce Training Grant may gain traction |

### Openings

| Opening | Nature | Assessment |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Vance as VP | Direct access to executive | High potential; depends on Trump admin priorities |
| Project 2025 | Implementation vehicle | High potential; also high controversy |
| State-level experimentation | Workforce training, industrial policy | Under-exploited by AC |
| Popular translation | Etymon-style content | AC doesn't do this; gap for others |
| Institution founding | Build what AC proposes | AC proposes but doesn't build |

---

## Operational Understanding

### What They're Actually Doing

1. **Producing theory** — Essays, handbook, policy papers
2. **Building elite consensus** — Convening senators, advising campaigns
3. **Shifting Overton window** — Making protectionism, industrial policy, worker power speakable on the right
4. **Providing policy cover** — Giving conservative politicians "conservative" framing for interventionist policies
5. **Preparing for implementation** — Project 2025 participation; Trump admin positioning

### What They're Not Doing

1. **Building institutions** — No development bank, no training programs, no new structures
2. **Popular education** — Elite papers, not accessible content
3. **State-level engagement** — DC-focused
4. **Personnel development** — No training for operators
5. **Manufacturing actual policy** — Proposing, not implementing

### The Limitation

American Compass is **theory production for elite consumption**. It shifts what's thinkable for policymakers but doesn't:
- Build the institutions it proposes
- Train the people to run them
- Create popular support for them
- Engage beyond DC

This is the **think tank limitation**: papers are not institutions.

---

## For Action

### What American Compass Enables

- **Legitimation** — Their work makes developmental nationalism respectable for conservatives
- **Policy specificity** — Their proposals are concrete enough to implement
- **Elite access** — Their network includes people who might implement
- **Historical grounding** — Their American System framing provides precedent

### What Remains to Be Done (that AC doesn't do)

| Gap | Who Could Fill |
|-----|----------------|
| **Popular translation** | Etymon channel; accessible content |
| **Institution founding** | Actually build the development bank, training programs |
| **State-level work** | Engage Texas, Ohio, etc. where policy is happening |
| **Personnel development** | Train developmentalist operators |
| **Network beyond DC** | Build support in manufacturing regions |

### Alignment Assessment

| Your Concern | AC Position | Alignment |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| American System recovery | Explicit embrace | High |
| Oikonomia/chrematistics | Implicit (national interest vs. growth) | Moderate |
| Philological recovery | Not addressed | Gap — you do this |
| Institutional founding | Proposes but doesn't build | Gap — you could extend |
| Popular translation | Not their mode | Gap — Etymon channel |
