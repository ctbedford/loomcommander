## The Commitment (TO BE WRITTEN)

*This section awaits the commitment. It cannot be written by synthesis of scattered positions — only by decision.*

```
I believe the Church is _____.
It is concretely located at _____.
House Bedford will worship at _____ parish, under _____ bishop/pastor.
I hold this because _____.
This commits me to: _____.
```

## The Journey So Far

### Origin: Baptist Protestant Background

The starting point. What this provided:
- Scripture as authority
- Personal relationship with Christ
- Suspicion of ritual and hierarchy
- Conversion experience as central

### Phase 1: Calvinism

What you learned:
- Systematic theology
- Sovereignty of God
- Predestination debates
- Reformed epistemology

### Phase 2: The Historical Turn

The question that changed everything:

> "Why is America and where I'm from so different in teachings than those 1st century Christians?"

This is the genealogical question. You applied to ecclesiology the same method you apply everywhere: *how did we get here?*

What you found:
- Historical Christian practices and beliefs from the 1st century did not correspond with Calvinist and evangelical beliefs
- Something happened between the Apostles and the Reformation
- The Reformation was a break, not a recovery

### Phase 3: Investigation of Ancient Churches

You investigated:
- **Roman Catholicism** — strongest institutional continuity, but post-Vatican II disrupted
- **Eastern Orthodoxy** — strongest claim to unchanged practice, but ethnic and compromised

## The Current Diagnosis

### What Protestantism Lacks

| Issue | Diagnosis |
|-------|-----------|
| **Sacramental mystery** | Rejected. Eucharist as memorial, not presence. |
| **Historical continuity** | Broken at Reformation. "Church was wrong for 1500 years, we recovered it." |
| **Liturgical inheritance** | Replaced with innovation. Each generation starts fresh. |
| **Hierarchy** | Rejected or minimized. Every man his own pope. |
| **Theosis** | Unknown or rejected. Salvation as transaction, not transformation. |

### What Rome Has and Lacks

| Has | Lacks (post-Vatican II) |
|-----|-------------------------|
| Apostolic succession | Liturgical integrity (Novus Ordo disrupted tradition) |
| Sacramental theology | Clear boundary (who is Catholic?) |
| Global reach | Resistance to modernity |
| Intellectual tradition (Aquinas) | Trust (abuse scandals, institutional compromise) |

### What Orthodoxy Has and Lacks

| Has | Lacks |
|-----|-------|
| Unchanged liturgy (Divine Liturgy) | Ethnic particularity (Greek, Russian, Serbian churches) |
| Theosis as goal | American presence (convert parishes exist but sparse) |
| Sacramental realism | Institutional unity (autocephalous churches, Moscow vs. Constantinople) |
| Answer to Evola (synergy, not grace-works dichotomy) | Accessibility (services long, in foreign languages) |

---

## The Orthodox Answer to Evola

This is significant and deserves articulation.

**The Evola Problem:** Grace vs. works seems like a Protestant/Catholic debate that misses something. Both sides accept the frame. Is there a tradition that dissolves the dichotomy?

**The Orthodox Answer:** Synergy.
- Neither grace alone (Protestant) nor works earning grace (caricature of Catholic)
- Theosis: becoming like God through cooperation of divine grace and human will
- The goal is not "going to heaven" but "becoming god" (small g — deification, not identity)
- This requires liturgical practice, sacramental participation, ascetic discipline

**Why this resonates:**
- Integrates action and grace (matches Ilyin's position in ethics)
- Makes worship transformative, not merely expressive
- Gives content to "what man is for" (theosis = telos)
- Dissolves Evola's critique of Christianity as passive

---

## The Unresolved Questions

### 1. Which Orthodoxy?

If Orthodoxy, which jurisdiction?
- **Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America** — largest, but Greek ethnic character
- **Orthodox Church in America (OCA)** — autocephalous, more American
- **Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese** — historically Arab, but welcoming to converts
- **Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR)** — conservative, but Russian politics

**The convert's dilemma:** Orthodoxy claims to be the Church, but it presents as ethnic churches. Which parish in Northwest Arkansas?

### 2. What About Rome?

The Catholic Church has claims too:
- Petrine primacy (Matthew 16:18)
- Institutional continuity
- Intellectual tradition (Aquinas, natural law)
- Global rather than ethnic

**Against:** Vatican II disrupted tradition. The Novus Ordo is not the Mass of the Ages. The current papacy causes concern.

**For:** Traditional Latin Mass communities exist (FSSP, ICKSP). The intellectual tradition is unmatched.

### 3. What About Staying Protestant?

Is there a case for remaining?
- **Anglican:** The Cavalier heritage is Anglican. The Episcopal Church is lost, but ACNA exists.
- **Reformed:** Intellectual rigor, covenant theology, but lacks sacramental realism.
- **Lutheran:** Sacramental, but German ethnic character, and Reformation break remains.

**Problem:** If you've diagnosed Protestantism as deficient in sacramental mystery and historical continuity, staying Protestant requires either:
1. Denying the diagnosis
2. Accepting the deficiency as acceptable
3. Finding a Protestant tradition that addresses the deficiency (Anglican?)

### 4. The Family Question

This is not just about you. It's about House Bedford.
- Where will the children be baptized?
- Where will they receive first communion?
- What tradition will form them?
- What will they inherit?

The Cavalier inheritance is Anglican. Converting to Orthodoxy would break that chain. But if Orthodoxy is true, the chain was already broken at the Reformation.

## The Lee Kuan Yew Directive

From the constructed dialogue:

> "Sit in the Divine Liturgy. Not as tourism. As investigation. Then decide."

**The protocol:**
1. Attend Divine Liturgy (Orthodox)
2. Not as observer — as participant (as far as non-Orthodox can participate)
3. Multiple times, different parishes
4. Then make a decision

**The principle:** Ecclesiology admits no refinement — only decision. "Orthodoxy is interesting" is not a position. "We will attend _____ parish" is.

---

## Downstream Implications

Whatever the decision, it commits to:

| If Orthodox | Commits to |
|-------------|------------|
| Catechesis | Formal instruction period (can be 1-2 years) |
| Chrismation | Received into the Church |
| Fasting | Serious fasting calendar (Wednesdays, Fridays, four major fasts) |
| Liturgical life | Sunday Liturgy is non-negotiable, plus feast days |
| Confession | Regular sacramental confession to a priest |
| Children | Baptized and chrismated as infants, communing from infancy |

| If Catholic (Traditional) | Commits to |
|---------------------------|------------|
| RCIA | Formal instruction period |
| Confirmation | Received into the Church |
| Mass attendance | Sunday obligation, plus holy days |
| Confession | Regular sacramental confession |
| Finding TLM community | Traditional Latin Mass parish (FSSP, ICKSP, diocesan TLM) |
| Children | Baptized as infants, first communion around age 7 |

| If Anglican (ACNA) | Commits to |
|--------------------|------------|
| Confirmation | If not already confirmed |
| Finding solid parish | ACNA quality varies widely |
| Accepting Protestant status | Remaining in Reformation tradition |
| Children | Baptized, confirmed, formed in Anglican tradition |

---

## The Decision Framework

### What Matters Most?

Rank these in order of importance:

1. **Historical continuity** — Unbroken line to the Apostles
2. **Sacramental realism** — Real presence, real transformation
3. **Theosis as telos** — Deification as goal, not just forgiveness
4. **Accessibility** — Parish available in Northwest Arkansas
5. **Family inheritance** — Continuity with Cavalier Anglican heritage
6. **Intellectual tradition** — Robust theology, answers to hard questions
7. **Practical formation** — Fasting, prayer rule, ascetic discipline

### The Hierarchy Suggests:

If 1-3 dominate → Orthodoxy or Traditional Catholicism
If 4-5 dominate → ACNA or available Protestant option
If 6 dominates → Traditional Catholicism (Aquinas, natural law tradition)
If 7 dominates → Orthodoxy (ascetic tradition most intact)

---

## Action Required

### Immediate

1. Research Orthodox parishes in Northwest Arkansas
2. Research Traditional Catholic communities in Northwest Arkansas
3. Research ACNA parishes in Northwest Arkansas

### Investigation

4. Attend Divine Liturgy at least 3 times at different Orthodox parishes
5. Attend Traditional Latin Mass at least 3 times
6. Attend ACNA liturgy at least 3 times

### Decision

7. By [DATE], make the decision
8. Begin catechesis/instruction
9. Update this document with the commitment

## The Test

When this document moves from ◔ (diagnosed) to ◉ (owned), it will contain:

> "I believe the Church is _____. House Bedford will worship at _____ parish, under _____ bishop. We chose this because _____. This commits us to _____."

Until then, the credo is incomplete.
