# INTEREST

**Type:** Instance
**Frameworks:** Etymon Method, Oikonomia vs Chrematistics
**Output:** Etymon
**Status:** Incubating

## INTEREST FROM Being-Between

The operator: **FROM** — traces derivation

## Excavation

Latin *interesse* — to be between, to be among, to make a difference
*Inter-* (between) + *esse* (to be)

"It interests me" originally meant "it is between me" — it stands in my space, it concerns me, it matters to me. Interest was **what matters**.

---

## Drift

**What matters to you → Rate of return**

1. **Interest (concern):** What stands between you and indifference. What you care about.
2. **Interest (stake):** What you have at stake in an outcome.
3. **Interest (advantage):** What serves your benefit.
4. **Interest (rate):** The price of borrowed money. A percentage.

The word that meant *being-between* became the price of time. That drift explains why finance feels soulless — the word for caring became a number.

## The Lending Connection

When you lend money, your *interest* is in its return. The interest you charge is compensation for your interest (concern, risk, care). The word originally carried the relational logic — you're interested because you're *in between*, you're exposed, you care.

Modern interest rates float free of relationship. The rate is calculated, not felt. The being-between becomes a spread.

## Recovery

What would it mean to recover interest?

- **Lending as caring:** You're interested because you're exposed to this person, this project
- **Rate as relationship:** The price reflects the between-ness, not just the algorithm
- **Interest alignment:** When we say "aligned interests," we're saying "we're between the same things"

---

## The Compression

**INTEREST:** From being-between to rate of return. What matters became a percentage. Recovery means remembering that interest is exposure — you're interested because you're *in* it, standing between outcome and indifference.
