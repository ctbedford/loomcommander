# CORPORATION

**Type:** Instance
**Frameworks:** Etymon Method, Oikonomia vs Chrematistics
**Output:** Etymon
**Status:** Incubating

## The Body BEHIND Corporation

The operator: **BEHIND** — what's concealed

---

## Excavation

Latin *corpus* — body. *Corporare* — to form into a body. *Corporatio* — the forming of a body.

A corporation was a body made of people. The *corpus* was collective — monks, guilds, universities, towns. Groups incorporated to act as one.

The body was mortal-ish. Monasteries could outlast individual monks, guilds could outlast individual craftsmen. But the body required members. No people, no corpus.

## Drift

**Body of people → Legal person → Immortal entity → Disembodied capital**

1. **Body of people:** Collective form for common action
2. **Legal person:** The body gains legal standing distinct from members
3. **Immortal entity:** The corporation outlives all founders, members, owners
4. **Disembodied capital:** The "body" is pure financial structure; humans are inputs

The modern corporation is a body with no body. It's "incorporated" but has no *corpus*. It's a legal fiction that can own property, make contracts, sue and be sued — but cannot die, feel, or be held in quite the way persons can.

## What the Drift Costs

When corporations were bodies:
- They needed members (no people, no body)
- They could be chartered for specific purposes (the body had a telos)
- They could be dissolved (mortality was possible)
- Responsibility was locatable (humans were present)

When corporations are immortal persons:
- They persist without members (shareholders are not the body)
- Purpose is "shareholder value" (generic chrematistic telos)
- Death is rare and difficult (legal structures resist dissolution)
- Responsibility diffuses (no one is the corporation)

## The Chrematistic Turn

The corporation solved chrematistics' mortality problem. Individual accumulators die. Corporations don't. Wealth can compound beyond any human lifetime.

Limited liability solved the risk problem. You can participate in accumulation without personal exposure. Capital grows; persons are shielded.

## Recovery

What would mortal corporations look like?

- **Sunset clauses:** Corporations chartered for limited terms, requiring renewal
- **Purpose locks:** The corporate "body" has a telos beyond accumulation
- **Steward ownership:** Non-extractive, non-transferable ownership
- **Living body requirements:** Structures that require ongoing human membership
- **Death possibility:** Legal structures that can and do die

The question: What is the *corpus* — the body — of this corporation? If the answer is "nothing" or "financial structure," the word has drifted far from its root.

## The Compression

**CORPORATION:** From body of people to immortal legal fiction. The *corpus* was once collective — humans incorporated for common purpose. Now corporations are "bodies" with no bodies, legal persons that cannot die. Recovery means asking: what would it mean for corporations to be mortal again?
