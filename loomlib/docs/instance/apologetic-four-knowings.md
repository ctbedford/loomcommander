# Apologetic: The Four Knowings

**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Status:** research (pre-production)

---

## Dominant Reading

**Received view:** A typology of knowledge that explains the "meaning crisis" and points toward its resolution. Four complementary forms (propositional, procedural, perspectival, participatory) that modern culture has lost balance among. The framework as diagnostic tool for what's wrong with us and prescriptive path toward wisdom, integration, and flourishing.

**Confirms:**
- Liberal therapeutic culture: knowledge as self-help for meaning-seekers
- Academic inclusivism: cognition finally gets a unified theory
- Spiritual-but-not-religious synthesis: ancient wisdom made safe for moderns
- Democratic epistemology: everyone has access to all four knowings
- Self-improvement telos: the goal is "integration" and "relevance realization"

**Makes original a precursor to:**
- The secular-sacred synthesis project (Vervaeke's explicit telos)
- A new "ecology of practices" that borrows from traditions without commitment to any
- The Rebel Wisdom / Emerge / meaning-crisis-industrial-complex that offers practice without particularity

---

## Domestication Operation

**Primary operation:** Syncretizing — abstracting structural features from particular traditions (Platonic, Buddhist, Christian, Daoist) to create a universal theory available to anyone regardless of lineage.

**Secondary operations:**
- **Therapeutizing** — "participatory knowing" becomes something you work on in practice, a skill to develop, rather than a condition received through initiation
- **Secularizing** — the divine/transcendent dimension is replaced with "relevance realization," a cognitive science term for what used to be grace or illumination
- **Democratizing** — what was rare (wisdom) becomes universally accessible through the right "ecology of practices"
- **Presentizing** — the framework claims to recover what was lost, but in a form compatible with contemporary assumptions

**How it works:** Vervaeke performs a brilliant abstraction. He extracts the *structure* of ancient wisdom traditions — that knowing has multiple dimensions — while stripping the *content* that made them strange. The result is a framework that sounds like it's recovering something ancient but is actually perfectly compatible with the therapeutic sensibility. You can have "participatory knowing" without belonging to anything. You can achieve "wisdom" through practices you select and combine according to your own judgment.

The key move: replacing *initiation* with *practice selection*. Traditional participatory knowing came through being received into something — a lineage, a mystery, a community that knew you. Vervaeke's version comes through choosing an "ecology of practices" that works for you. The subject remains sovereign.

## Suppressed Element

**What's flattened:**

1. **The initiatic dimension.** Participatory knowing in traditions required being initiated — received into something that pre-existed you and wasn't chosen. The Eleusinian mysteries, Christian baptism, Sufi tariqa — these weren't "practices" you added to your portfolio. They were deaths and rebirths that the subject didn't control.

2. **Lineage as epistemological.** In traditions, *who you learned from* determined what you could know. The transmission wasn't just information but capacity that moved through relationship. Vervaeke's model treats content as extractable from lineage — you can learn the structure of wisdom from a YouTube lecture series.

3. **The exclusivity claim.** Particular traditions claimed their path was *the* path — not one option among many. Plato: if you haven't done the dialectical work, you literally cannot see the Forms. Christianity: outside the Church, no salvation. This isn't ecumenical tolerance; it's mutual exclusion. The syncretic framework suppresses this by treating all traditions as contributing pieces to a unified puzzle.

4. **The vertical/transcendent dimension.** Traditional knowing involved vertical hierarchy — gods above, ancestors behind, the transcendent pulling upward. Vervaeke's "relevance realization" is horizontal and immanent. It's about functional fit between agent and arena, not participation in something that transcends both.

**What made interpreters uncomfortable:** That ancient wisdom wasn't available to everyone. That you had to *belong* to something to know certain things. That traditions made mutually exclusive claims. That wisdom wasn't a skill you developed but a grace you received.

---

## Original Strangeness

**The challenging core:** Knowing as dependent on belonging. You cannot know participatorily without being participatorily known. This isn't a practice you do; it's a position you occupy through no choice of your own.

The traditions Vervaeke draws from would find his synthesis strange:
- **Plato:** Only the philosophically educated — a small elite who've undergone decades of dialectical training — can see the Forms. This isn't democratic.
- **Christianity:** Knowing God requires being known by God first (1 Cor 13:12). The initiative isn't yours. And it happens through a specific Church, not a chosen practice ecology.
- **Buddhism:** The sangha (community) is one of the Three Jewels. You can't extract the practices from the lineage.

**Form of life assumed:** A world where you are born into something — a people, a lineage, a religious tradition — and that inheritance determines what you can know. Not because you chose it, but because it chose you. The modern autonomous subject who selects from a buffet of practices is precisely what these traditions *weren't*.

**Question being answered:** Not "how do I achieve wisdom?" (active, chosen) but "how am I being formed by what I belong to?" (passive, received).

## Counter-Readers

**Who saw clearly:**

- **Guénon** (*The Reign of Quantity*): Diagnosed the modern attempt to extract "universal" spiritual content from particular traditions as itself a symptom of degeneration. The perennialist synthesis he proposed was NOT democratic — it assumed an initiatic elite who could perceive the metaphysical unity. The popular "all paths lead to the same place" is precisely what he warned against.

- **MacIntyre** (*After Virtue*): Showed that rationality is tradition-constituted. You can't abstract universal ethical content from particular traditions because the content only makes sense within the tradition. The Enlightenment attempt to do so produced emotivism.

- **Pickstock** (*After Writing*): Argued that modernity's problem is precisely the attempt to make meaning available without liturgy — without the bodily, communal, particular practices that constitute the space where meaning can appear.

- **The Traditionalist critique generally:** Evola, Schuon, and others who saw that the modern synthesis project recapitulates the very error it claims to solve — treating wisdom as content to be extracted rather than capacity to be transmitted.

## Larper Tell

**The giveaway:** "I've developed my own ecology of practices combining Buddhist meditation, Stoic journaling, and contemplative movement."

**What it reveals:** The sovereign subject selecting from a buffet. This is precisely the condition that ancient traditions would have seen as impoverished — the person who belongs to nothing and therefore can know nothing participatorily. The confidence with which someone curates their practice portfolio demonstrates they haven't understood what participatory knowing requires: not choosing but being chosen.

**Alternative tell:** "Vervaeke helped me understand what the traditions were pointing at without having to commit to any of them." — The framework as inoculation against the very commitment it seems to recommend.

---

## Recovery

**What becomes available:** The question of belonging as prior to the question of practice.

If we let the strangeness surface:
- **Lineage becomes epistemological again** — who you learn from isn't incidental but constitutive of what you can know
- **Initiation becomes non-optional** — participatory knowing requires being received into something, not selecting practices
- **Exclusivity becomes thinkable** — traditions that claim "this is the way" aren't failing at tolerance; they're asserting something about the structure of reality
- **Hierarchy becomes intelligible** — not everyone can know everything; some knowledge requires positions not everyone occupies

**What question can we ask again:** What do I *belong to* that I didn't choose, and what does that belonging make knowable?

**Stakes:** The meaning crisis isn't solved by better practice selection. It's solved — if at all — by recovering or building actual communities of transmission that can initiate people into participatory knowing. Vervaeke's framework, brilliant as it is, might actually *prevent* this by making the structural features available without the initiatic content. You can feel like you understand participatory knowing while remaining a sovereign consumer of practices.

## Meta-Apologetic Note

**The loomlib adaptation itself:** The `fw-four-knowings` document in this graph has inherited the domesticated version. It presents the four knowings as a "diagnostic application" — a tool for evaluating learning and skill acquisition. This is useful but thin. The original strangeness (knowing as dependent on belonging) doesn't appear.

**The user commitments tension:** `idx-user-commitments` identifies this precisely:
- Vervaeke is a "teacher, not peer"
- He's listed as an **anti-peer** in the traditionalism section: "Vervaeke (syncretist where you're lineage-conscious)"
- The framework is "adopted" but the question remains: "Do you share their telos, or have you moved beyond them?"

The apologetic suggests: the useful structural content has been extracted, but the telos is different. Vervaeke's project is a secular-sacred synthesis available to anyone. The user's project is lineage-conscious particularity. These are not the same.

## Production Readiness

**Ready for full instance?** Partially — the domestic reading and suppressed element are clear, but the recovery needs sharpening.

**What's needed:**
- [ ] Clearer articulation of what "knowing through belonging" looks like operationally
- [ ] Examples of traditions that resist the synthesis (where exclusivity is load-bearing)
- [ ] Engagement with Vervaeke's own responses to this critique (has he addressed it?)

**Potential compositions:**
- Could compose with excavation of: WISDOM (what gets lost when wisdom becomes technique), INITIATION (the dying-into-knowing that synthesis erases), PARTICIPATION (the mystical sense vs. the cognitive science sense)
- Could inform apologetic of: MEANING CRISIS (the discourse itself), REBEL WISDOM (the media ecosystem), RELEVANCE REALIZATION (the key technical term)
- Could ground video on: "Participatory Knowing VERSUS Belonging" or "What Vervaeke Can't Give You"

**Suggested operator:** VERSUS (Participatory knowing as practice VERSUS participatory knowing as belonging)
