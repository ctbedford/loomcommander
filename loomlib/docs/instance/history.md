## HISTORY FROM Inquiry

The operator: **FROM** — traces derivation

## Excavation

Greek *historia* — inquiry, knowledge from inquiry, a narrative of what was learned through inquiry.

From *histor* — one who knows, a wise man, a judge. From *eidenai* — to know, related to *idein* — to see. The witness who has *seen*.

Herodotus opens his *Histories*: "This is the display of the inquiry (*historiē*) of Herodotus of Halicarnassus."

History was not "the past." History was *inquiry into* the past. Active investigation. The historian was the one who asked questions, traveled, interviewed, compared accounts, and judged what likely happened.

## Drift

**Inquiry → Account → Record → The Past Itself**

1. **Inquiry:** Active investigation, judgment, witness
2. **Account:** The narrative produced by inquiry
3. **Record:** Documentation of what happened
4. **The past:** "History" = what occurred, not the investigation of it

Modern usage: "That's history" = "That's over." "History teaches us..." = "The past shows us..."

The inquirer disappeared. History became a container of fixed facts rather than an ongoing investigation. The question "how do we know?" became invisible.

## What the Drift Costs

If history is inquiry:
- The historian's judgment is present
- Sources are evaluated, compared, questioned
- "History" is always provisional, subject to better inquiry
- The question is "how can we find out?"

If history is the past:
- Facts are simply there to be collected
- The historian is a passive recorder
- "History" is fixed, known, unquestionable
- The question is "what happened?"

## The Methodological Loss

Herodotus judged sources. He said "I am obliged to report what is said, but I am not obliged to believe it." He compared accounts. He noted when stories conflicted.

The historian-as-inquirer knew that evidence was incomplete, witnesses unreliable, accounts interested. Inquiry meant wrestling with that uncertainty.

The historian-as-recorder assumes the past is accessible. Just find the documents. History becomes data retrieval.

## Recovery

What would history-as-inquiry look like?

- **Visible judgment:** Historians showing their reasoning, not hiding behind "the facts"
- **Source criticism foregrounded:** How do we know what we claim to know?
- **Inquiry as ongoing:** "History" as verb, not just noun
- **The histor restored:** The one who asks, investigates, sees, judges

## The Compression

**HISTORY:** From inquiry to record. Herodotus investigated, judged, and displayed his inquiry. Modern "history" means the past itself — a container of facts. Recovery means restoring the inquirer: the one who asks how we know, compares sources, and judges what likely happened.
