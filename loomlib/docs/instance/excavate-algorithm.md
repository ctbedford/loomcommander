# Algorithm: FROM Person TO Procedure

**Framework:** Etymon Method
**Operator:** FROM... TO
**Channel:** etymon

## The Excavation

*Algorithm* comes from a man's name: **al-Khwarizmi** — Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, a 9th-century Persian mathematician working in Baghdad's House of Wisdom. His name meant "the one from Khwarezm," a region in present-day Uzbekistan.

When his mathematical treatises were translated into Latin, his name became *Algoritmi* or *Algorismus*. The word referred not to any procedure but to **the methods this specific person taught** — particularly his book on Hindu-Arabic numerals that revolutionized calculation in Europe.

The etymon: a person's authority. A named source. A teacher whose methods you followed because he had proven them.

---

## The Drift

**Stage 1 — From Person to Method (Medieval)**
"Algorithm" initially meant: the specific procedures al-Khwarizmi taught. Not any procedure — *his* procedures. To do "algorism" was to calculate using the methods from his books, particularly decimal place-value arithmetic. The person remained in the word.

**Stage 2 — From Method to Any Procedure (17th-18th century)**
As mathematics formalized, "algorithm" generalized. Now it meant any step-by-step procedure. The person disappeared. What remained was the structure: do this, then this, then this. Al-Khwarizmi's name became an abstraction.

**Stage 3 — From Procedure to Black Box (20th century)**
With computation, algorithms became invisible. Not procedures you follow but procedures machines follow. Not methods you understand but processes that produce outputs. The operational meaning — "do these steps in this order" — remained, but the human practitioner vanished.

**Stage 4 — From Black Box to Authority (21st century)**
The contemporary inversion: "The algorithm" as a faceless power. Social media says "the algorithm" decides what you see. Hiring platforms say "the algorithm" filters candidates. The word that once named a person's authority now names **authority without a person** — judgment without a judge, decision without a decider.

---

## The Operational Loss

What capacity was available when *algorithm* meant al-Khwarizmi's methods?

1. **Attribution**: Methods came from someone. You could evaluate, question, disagree. The procedure had a face.

2. **Transmission**: You learned algorithms from teachers who learned from teachers. The chain of warrant mattered.

3. **Judgment**: Following a method required understanding it. You were the practitioner, not the substrate.

4. **Contestability**: Named methods could be debated. "Al-Khwarizmi says X, but consider Y." Authority was earned and challengeable.

What's lost in the contemporary drift:

1. **Anonymity**: "The algorithm" has no author. Even when engineers write it, the appeal is to procedural authority, not personal warrant.

2. **Opacity**: You don't follow the algorithm; it processes you. The human moved from practitioner to input.

3. **Inevitability**: "The algorithm decided" functions as a terminus. It ends inquiry rather than inviting it.

4. **Deference**: The same word that once meant "do what this wise teacher showed" now means "accept what this process produces."

## The Recovery

What would it mean to recover the etymon?

**Algorithm as attributed method**: Insist on the person behind the procedure. Not "the algorithm ranked you" but "engineers at Company X designed a system that ranked you, using these principles, with these tradeoffs." Attribution restores contestability.

**Algorithm as practiced skill**: Shift the human from input back to practitioner. An algorithm is something you *do*, not something done *to* you. The procedural literacy that was algorism's original gift — understanding method well enough to execute it — becomes legible again.

**Algorithm as teaching lineage**: Procedures come from somewhere. They encode decisions, priorities, worldviews. Asking "whose algorithm?" is asking "whose judgment, trained by whom, serving what ends?"

**The recovery test**: Can you name the al-Khwarizmi? Not in all cases — sometimes procedures are genuinely collective or evolved. But where human decisions designed the system, the recovery is: *make the deciders legible again*.

---

## The Insight

The drift from al-Khwarizmi to "the algorithm" traces a particular kind of modern displacement: **authority without accountability**. The word that once concentrated judgment in a named person now disperses it into procedural anonymity.

Contemporary "algorithm" functions as a secularized providence — an invisible hand that sorts and ranks and decides, but to whom no appeal is possible because there is no *whom*.

The etymological recovery is this: there is always a who. Al-Khwarizmi's name in every algorithm is a reminder that procedures don't emerge from nowhere. They are taught, designed, implemented, deployed. The question "whose algorithm?" is never a category error.

When we forget the person in the procedure, we surrender contestability. The recovery is not nostalgia for simpler times but clarity about how decisions hide behind process.

## Summary

| Element | Analysis |
|---------|----------|
| **Etymon** | al-Khwarizmi — "the one from Khwarezm," a named teacher |
| **Original sense** | Methods from a specific authority, learned and practiced |
| **Drift mechanism** | Generalization → mechanization → anonymization |
| **What's lost** | Attribution, contestability, practitioner agency |
| **Recovery** | Insist on the person behind the procedure |
| **Operator** | FROM person TO procedure (and back) |

## Verification Notes

**Status:** draft — awaiting source verification

**Sources needed for promotion to verified:**
- [ ] OED entry for "algorithm" — confirm Latin *Algoritmi* derivation
- [ ] Etymonline entry — cross-reference drift stages
- [ ] Al-Khwarizmi's *Kitab al-Jabr* — primary source on original methods
- [ ] Secondary source on medieval reception of Hindu-Arabic numerals in Europe

**Core claims to verify:**
1. Al-Khwarizmi's name → Algoritmi/Algorismus in Latin translations
2. Original usage referred specifically to his decimal arithmetic methods
3. Generalization timeline (17th-18th century)
4. Contemporary "the algorithm" as authority-without-person is accurate characterization
