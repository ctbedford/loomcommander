# The Managerial Revolution

**Author:** James Burnham
**Published:** 1941
**Category:** Political Economy, Elite Theory

---

## Core Argument

Capitalism is not being replaced by socialism but by a new social system: managerialism. The old capitalist class (owners) is being displaced by a new ruling class (managers) — the executives, administrators, engineers, and bureaucrats who actually run large organizations.

This is happening in all advanced societies regardless of ideology. New Deal America, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia — all are converging toward managerial rule. The formal ideology (liberalism, fascism, communism) matters less than the underlying class shift.

## Key Concepts

### The Managerial Class
- Not owners but controllers
- Derive power from position in organization, not property
- Include corporate executives, government administrators, technical experts
- Their interests differ from both capitalists and workers

### The Separation of Ownership and Control
- In large corporations, stockholders own but don't control
- Managers make decisions; owners receive dividends
- This is a structural shift, not a conspiracy
- The corporation becomes a quasi-political institution

### Convergence
- All industrial societies move toward managerialism
- Soviet planners and American executives are the same class
- Ideological differences are superstructure; managerial power is base
- The Cold War obscures class identity

### The State as Manager
- The state expands to regulate, coordinate, plan
- This empowers administrators, not voters
- "Big government" and "big business" produce the same ruling class
- New Deal liberals and corporate executives are allies, not enemies

### Ideological Superstructure
- Each class produces ideologies that justify its rule
- Capitalists: property rights, free markets, limited government
- Managers: expertise, efficiency, planning, public interest
- Managerial ideologies appear "neutral" but serve managerial power

### The Future
- Burnham predicted (in 1941) continued managerial ascent
- Neither capitalist restoration nor proletarian revolution
- The question: which faction of managers will rule?
- National or international? Corporate or governmental?

## Relation to Bedford Credo

### Serves: Political Philosophy (Category VI)

**The regime question:** Liberal democracy may be a facade. The real power lies with managers — unelected administrators, corporate executives, technical experts. Your sense that democratic politics is "theater" finds support here.

**Against both liberalism and socialism:** Burnham dissolves the Left-Right spectrum at the regime level. Both sides empower managers. The alternative must be sought elsewhere.

**The sovereignty question:** If managers rule, where does sovereignty lie? Not with the people (democracy), not with the owners (capitalism), not with the workers (socialism). With whoever controls the administrative apparatus.

### Serves: Economics (Category VII)

**The corporation question:** Large corporations are not really "private" — they're quasi-governmental. This aligns with your List-oikonomia position: economics is political, not autonomous.

**Against free-market capitalism:** Burnham shows that "capitalism" in the classical sense no longer exists. The choice is not market vs. state but types of managerial control.

**Financialization:** The separation of ownership and control enables financialization — owners extract value without productive responsibility. Your chrematistics critique gains support.

### Serves: Strategic Posture

**Who actually rules?** Your phased approach requires knowing who to engage. If managers rule, political theater matters less than institutional position. The administrative state, the corporate boardroom, the credentialing system — these are power centers.

**The class question:** Are you part of the managerial class? PathX, data analytics, technical expertise — these are managerial skills. The question: serve the managers or build an alternative?

## Key Passages

> "What is occurring in this transition is a drive for social dominance, for power and privilege, for the position of ruling class, by the social group or class of the managers."

> "The managers are, in a quite objective and unmetaphorical sense, becoming the new ruling class of society."

> "The abolition of private property in the instruments of production does not abolish exploitation; it abolishes only one specific form of the exploiting class."

> "The separation of ownership and control... is one of the most significant social changes of modern times."

## Authority Status

**Diagnostic tool, not normative authority.**

Burnham provides elite theory and class analysis that cuts through ideological confusion. His predictions proved partly correct: the administrative state has grown; managers do wield enormous power.

**Limits:**
- Burnham later became a conservative Cold Warrior — different concerns
- Convergence thesis was wrong in detail (Soviet collapse)
- He provides diagnosis, not prescription

**Connection to Curtis Yarvin:** Yarvin's "Cathedral" thesis is Burnham updated. The managerial elite (academia, media, bureaucracy) forms a distributed ruling class. You engage Yarvin; Burnham is the predecessor.

**The political question:** Does understanding managerialism lead to apoliteia (the game is rigged) or targeted engagement (capture the administrative state)?

- `inst-credo-political` (who actually rules?)
- `inst-credo-economics` (corporation as quasi-government)
- `idx-credo-source-pipeline` (Tier 3 political philosophy)

**This source enables:**
- Grounding the "democratic theater" intuition
- Understanding the regime beneath ideological surfaces
- Connecting to contemporary elite theory (Yarvin, American Affairs)
