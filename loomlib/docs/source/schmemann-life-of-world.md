# For the Life of the World

**Author:** Alexander Schmemann
**Published:** 1963
**Category:** Ecclesiology, Sacramental Theology

---

## Core Argument

Christianity is not a "religion" in the modern sense — a private sphere of spiritual practice separate from "secular" life. The Eucharist reveals what the world truly is: a gift from God meant to be received, blessed, and offered back. The liturgy is not escape from the world but the world's true meaning made visible.

The tragedy of modern Christianity is that it accepted the secular/sacred split. It retreated into "religion" and abandoned the world to secularism. But the original Christian vision was cosmic — all of creation is to be transfigured.

## Key Concepts

### The World as Sacrament
- "In the beginning" the whole world was given as sacrament — means of communion with God
- The Fall was treating creation as an end in itself, not as gift
- The Eucharist restores right relationship: receive, bless, offer, share
- Every meal can be sacramental; the Eucharist reveals this

### The Liturgy as Cosmos
- The liturgy is not one activity among many but the revelation of reality
- "The Church is not a religious society... it is the new life of all creation"
- Worship is not escape from the world but entry into the world's true meaning
- The Kingdom of God is not "elsewhere" — it breaks into this world in the liturgy

### Against "Religion"
- Modern religion = private, interior, separated from public life
- Christianity accepted this ghetto to survive secularism
- But this is a betrayal: Christianity claims the whole world for Christ
- The secular/sacred split is not neutral — it's a defeat

### Secularism as Failed Christianity
- Secularism didn't emerge from paganism; it emerged from Christendom
- When Christianity became "religion," the world was left orphaned
- Secular "progress" is residual Christian hope without Christ
- The answer is not more religion but the recovery of sacramental vision

### The Eucharist as Answer
- "Take, bless, break, give" — the pattern of redeemed life
- We offer the world back to God, and He returns it transfigured
- The Eucharist makes us "partakers of the divine nature"
- Not magic ritual but participation in Christ's own offering

## Relation to Bedford Credo

### Serves: Ecclesiology (Category X)

**What is the Church?** Not an institution that dispenses religious services but the new creation already present. The Church is "the sacrament of the Kingdom" — making visible what all creation is meant to be.

**Why Orthodoxy?** Schmemann's argument: the Orthodox liturgy preserves the cosmic vision that Western Christianity lost. The Reformation and Counter-Reformation both accepted the secular/sacred split; Orthodoxy never did.

### Serves: Metaphysics (Category I)

**Is matter inferior?** No — matter is to be transfigured, not escaped. The bread and wine become Christ's body and blood; this is the destiny of all creation. Sacramental metaphysics bridges Traditionalist hierarchy and Christian incarnationalism.

**The real vs. the symbolic:** Schmemann rejects the modern "merely symbolic" view. Sacraments are real participation in divine reality, not illustrations of ideas.

### Serves: Philosophy of History (Category VIII)

**Secularism diagnosis:** Modern secularism is not external to Christianity — it's Christianity's shadow. The "death of God" happened because Christians abandoned the world. The answer is not religious revival but sacramental recovery.

**Against Spengler:** Schmemann offers an alternative to resignation. The Kingdom breaks in now, not at the end of history. Civilizations may decline, but the Eucharist continues.

## Key Passages

> "The world was created as the 'matter,' the material of one all-embracing eucharist, and man was created as the priest of this cosmic sacrament."

> "Christianity... is not a religion. Religion is needed where there is a wall of separation between God and man. But Christ has broken down the wall between man and God."

> "The liturgy is not an 'escape from life' but rather the revelation of the true life."

> "Secularism is a tragedy, not because it negates the existence of God, but because it denies that the world has anything to do with God."

## Authority Status

**Engaged, trending toward authority.**

Schmemann is the pastoral complement to Lossky. Where Lossky is philosophical, Schmemann is liturgical. Together they form the standard introduction to Orthodox Christianity for Western converts.

**Personal relevance:** Schmemann's critique of "religion" aligns with your critique of liberalism — both diagnose a false separation that impoverishes both sides. His sacramental vision addresses the metaphysical question: matter is not inferior but to be transfigured.

**The liturgy test:** Lee Kuan Yew's constructed advice — "Sit in the Divine Liturgy. Not as tourism. As investigation." Schmemann explains why.
