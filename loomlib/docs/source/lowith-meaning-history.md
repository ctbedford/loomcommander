# Meaning in History

**Author:** Karl Löwith
**Published:** 1949
**Category:** Philosophy of History

---

## Core Argument

The modern idea of historical progress is a secularized version of Christian eschatology. The belief that history is moving toward a goal — whether Marxist utopia, liberal end of history, or scientific paradise — derives from the Christian hope for the Kingdom of God.

But secularized eschatology is incoherent. Without God as the agent of history, progress has no guarantor. The modern world inherited the structure of Christian hope (history has meaning, moves toward a goal) while rejecting its content (God's providence, Christ's return). The result is either self-deception or despair.

## Key Concepts

### Christian vs. Classical Views of Time
- **Classical (Greek, Roman):** History is cyclical or meaningless
- Eternal return; no progress; the cosmos repeats
- History is not the arena of salvation
- **Christian:** History is linear, moving toward an end
- Creation → Fall → Incarnation → Consummation
- What happens in time matters eternally

### The Biblical View
- History has a beginning (Creation) and end (Last Judgment)
- It is the arena of God's action: providence, salvation
- Time is not an illusion to escape but reality to inhabit
- The present has meaning because it relates to eschatological fulfillment

### Secularization of Eschatology
- Modern progress = Kingdom of God without God
- The structure remains: history moves toward fulfillment
- The content changes: human agency replaces divine providence
- Marx, Hegel, Comte, Condorcet — all secularized Christians

### The Incoherence
- If God guarantees the end, hope is warranted
- If only humans act, the end is not guaranteed
- Secular progress borrows Christian hope but cannot pay for it
- The result: oscillation between utopian hubris and nihilistic despair

### The Pagan Alternative
- Without eschatology, time is either cyclic or meaningless
- You can return to classical resignation (Spengler, Nietzsche)
- But this requires abandoning all hope for history
- Modern man cannot really do this — he's too Christian

### Faith vs. Knowledge
- Löwith concludes ambiguously
- Faith can sustain hope; reason cannot
- He does not say faith is true, only that progress without it fails
- The honest response to secularized eschatology is skepticism about progress

## Relation to Bedford Credo

### Serves: Philosophy of History (Category VIII)

**The central tension you carry:** Spengler (cycle, decline) vs. Christian hope (history moves toward consummation). Löwith diagnoses this precisely.

**The options:**
1. Return to classical resignation (Spengler): accept the cycle, abandon progress
2. Maintain secularized progress: borrow Christian structure, reject content (incoherent)
3. Recover authentic Christian eschatology: hope grounded in Christ, not human effort

**Your position:** You confess Christ, which implies option 3. But you also engage Spengler and the Traditionalists, which pulls toward option 1. Löwith forces the choice.

### Serves: Eschatology (Category IX)

**What is the End?** Löwith shows that your answer to this determines your philosophy of history. If the End is Christ's return and the New Creation, then civilizational decline is not the final word.

**Against both optimism and pessimism:** Secular progress is hubris. Spenglerian resignation is despair. Christian hope is neither — it's trust in God's action, not human achievement or cosmic necessity.

### Serves: Epistemology (Category IV)

**Faith and history:** Löwith suggests that the meaning of history is not empirically derivable. You cannot prove history is going somewhere by looking at history. Meaning comes from faith, not observation.

**Genealogical confirmation:** The genealogical method you use shows where ideas came from. Löwith applies this to "progress" — revealing its Christian genealogy.

## Key Passages

> "The modern mind has not made up its mind whether it should be Christian or pagan. It sees with one eye of faith and one of reason."

> "The eschatological future has become a historical future... and the heavenly city has become a terrestrial civilization."

> "The Christian hope for a final redemption has been secularized into a belief in indefinite progress."

> "The modern historical consciousness arises from the Christian view of history, and yet it is not Christian."

## Authority Status

**Diagnostic authority for the history question.**

Löwith (1897-1973) was a German-Jewish philosopher, student of Heidegger, who diagnosed the theological roots of modern historical thinking with precision.

**Relevance:** Your tension between Spengler and Christian hope is exactly what Löwith addresses. He doesn't resolve it (he was not a confessing Christian) but clarifies the stakes.

**Limit:** Löwith diagnoses; he does not prescribe. He shows that secular progress fails but does not confidently affirm Christian eschatology.
