# Debt: The First 5000 Years

**Author:** David Graeber
**Year:** 2011
**Type:** Book (anthropology/economic history)

---

## Summary

Graeber's central argument: the "myth of barter" — that money arose from barter — is historically false. In reality, **credit came first**. Primitive economies ran on debt, obligation, and trust long before coins existed. The standard economic textbook story (barter → money → credit) is exactly backwards; the actual history is (credit → coins → barter emerges only when credit systems break down).

This matters because it reveals that debt is not a neutral financial instrument but a **social relationship** — one that has historically been tied to violence, slavery, and moral transformation. The book traces how debt has been understood across civilizations and eras, showing that our current view (debt as mere financial obligation) is historically peculiar and morally impoverished.

Graeber connects debt to fundamental questions about obligation, morality, and human relationship. The German *Schuld* (debt/guilt) is not an accident — it reflects something true about how debt has functioned in human societies.

## Key Claims

1. **The myth of barter:** Economists assume money arose to solve barter's inefficiencies. But there's no anthropological evidence of barter economies. Barter appears between strangers, or when monetary systems collapse. Within communities: credit.

2. **Credit preceded coin:** Ancient economies ran on credit, tallies, and obligation. Coins came later, often connected to military operations (paying soldiers, extracting tribute).

3. **Debt creates social hierarchy:** Unlike exchange (which ends the relationship), debt creates ongoing relationship. The debtor is in the creditor's power. Debt is a technique of subordination.

4. **Primordial debt theory critique:** States often claim we owe an unpayable debt (to gods, ancestors, society). This legitimates state extraction. Graeber is skeptical — this "debt" is really just power claiming moral authority.

5. **Human economies vs. commercial economies:** In human economies, debts cannot be fully repaid because people are unique. You can't quantify a person. Commercial economies arise when violence (slavery, conquest) forces quantification of the unquantifiable.

6. **Alternating ages of virtual and physical money:** History shows oscillation: ages of virtual credit money (ancient, medieval) alternate with ages of bullion (Axial Age, modern era). We're now in a new age of virtual money (post-1971).

| **Human economies** | Economies where persons cannot be reduced to commodities | The older, more common form |
| **Commercial economies** | Economies where persons can be bought/sold (slavery enables this) | Arise through violence |
| **Virtual money** | Credit, tallies, ledgers — money as social relation | The original form; returning now |
| **Bullion money** | Coins, precious metal — money as thing | Emerges in militarized periods |

## Quotable Passages

> "For a very long time, the intellectual consensus has been that we can no longer ask Great Questions... This book is an attempt to begin asking them again."

Sets up the ambition of the project.

> "The very principle of exchange emerged largely as an effect of violence."

Exchange isn't natural — it emerges when social relations break down.

> "The difference between a debt and an obligation is that a debt can be precisely quantified. Quantification requires violence."

Why debt (quantified obligation) is different from mere social debt.

> "If history shows anything, it is that there's no better way to justify relations founded on violence, to make such relations seem moral, than by reframing them in the language of debt."

Debt as moral technology of domination.

## Connections

### Frameworks This Informs

- **Oikonomia vs Chrematistics** — Graeber's "human economies" are oikonomic (bounded by personhood). Commercial economies that quantify persons are chrematistic.
- **Etymon Method** — His treatment of *Schuld* (debt/guilt) is a philological excavation.

### Instances This Unlocks

- **CREDIT** — Provides the genealogy of credit-as-social-relation that credit excavation needs
- **DEBT** — Central text; the Schuld/guilt connection is documented here
- **INTEREST** — Usury debates across civilizations; why interest was seen as immoral
- **ACCOUNT** — Accounting as quantification technology that enables commercial economy

### Related Sources

- **Nietzsche, *Genealogy of Morality*** — Graeber engages with Nietzsche's debt-guilt thesis
- **Marx, *Capital*** — Different approach to same questions about commodification

## Reading Notes

### Part One: On the Experience of Moral Confusion

Opens with the question: "Why do we feel obligated to pay debts?" The moral force of debt is strange — why do we assume debtors should suffer?

The encounter with the activist who asked "but surely one has to pay one's debts" sparked the book. Graeber: actually, throughout history, debt jubilees and cancellations were normal. The absolute obligation to pay is recent.

### Part Two: The Myth of Barter

Demolishes the textbook story. Adam Smith's parable of barter among hunters is fiction. Anthropologists have never found a barter economy. What they find: credit, gift, redistribution.

Credit came first. Village economies ran on tabs, obligations, trust. Coins came later — often for paying soldiers or extracting tribute from conquered peoples.

### Part Three-Four: Primordial Debts and Cruelty

Examines debt theology — the idea of cosmic debt to gods. Critique: this is power pretending to be morality. States that claim we owe them an unpayable debt are just legitimating extraction.

The Axial Age (800-200 BCE): coincides with coinage, military expansion, slavery. The emergence of commercial economy happened through violence, not organic development.

### Part Five-Eight: Ages of Virtual and Bullion Money

Historical sweep: alternation between credit ages (more peaceful, less slavery) and bullion ages (more violent, more slavery). Currently: new age of virtual money post-1971 (end of gold standard). What will this mean?

### Part Nine-Twelve: The Implications

Medieval period: constraints on usury, moral limits on debt. Early modern: these constraints collapse.

Current era: we've created unprecedented levels of debt — personal, national, global. Graeber asks whether debt cancellation (like ancient jubilees) might be necessary.

## For Excavations

Graeber's contributions to economic genealogy:

1. **Debt/guilt connection** — The German *Schuld* as evidence that debt WAS guilt
2. **Credit as social relation** — Before it was score, it was trust
3. **Quantification as violence** — Why "just a number" is never neutral
4. **Alternating ages** — Context for current financial arrangements

His method: take the anthropological long view. What seems natural (money from barter, debt as neutral) is actually recent and contingent.
