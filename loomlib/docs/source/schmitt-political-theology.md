# Political Theology

**Author:** Carl Schmitt
**Published:** 1922
**Category:** Political Philosophy, Jurisprudence

---

## Core Argument

"Sovereign is he who decides on the exception."

All significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts. This is true not merely historically (they were borrowed) but systematically (they function the same way). The exception in law corresponds to the miracle in theology; the sovereign corresponds to God.

Liberalism tries to eliminate sovereignty by replacing decision with procedure. This is a metaphysical error: the exception cannot be eliminated, only concealed. Someone always decides. The question is who.

## Key Concepts

### The Exception
- The normal case proves nothing; the exception proves everything
- Law depends on order; order depends on decision in cases law cannot foresee
- The exception reveals the nature of sovereignty that the normal case conceals
- Liberalism pretends exceptions don't exist or can be proceduralized away

### Sovereignty
- Not the highest power but the power to decide the exception
- Not who makes laws but who can suspend them
- In crisis, the normal rules don't apply; someone must decide
- This decision cannot be derived from law — it creates the situation in which law applies

### Secularized Theology
- "All significant concepts of the modern doctrine of the state are secularized theological concepts"
- The omnipotent God → the omnipotent lawgiver
- The miracle → the exception
- Providence → historical progress
- Deism → the constitutional state (God creates and withdraws; law operates mechanically)

### Against Liberal Constitutionalism
- Liberalism wants to replace sovereignty with discussion
- It substitutes procedure for decision
- It pretends the exception can be governed by rules
- But someone must decide when the exception applies
- Every legal order presupposes a political order that law did not create

### Decisionism
- The decision, not the norm, is the ground of law
- "Authority, not truth, makes law" (Hobbes)
- This is not arbitrary: the decision creates the order that makes norms possible
- But it cannot itself be derived from norms

## Relation to Bedford Credo

### Serves: Political Philosophy (Category VI)

**The sovereignty question:** You ask "where does authority come from?" Schmitt answers: from the capacity to decide the exception. This is descriptive, not normative. But it forces the question: if not consent (liberal), then what?

**Against liberalism:** Schmitt's critique is the deepest available. Liberalism isn't wrong about particular policies; it's wrong about the nature of politics. It tries to substitute discussion for decision, procedure for sovereignty. This cannot work.

**Your position:** You "accept Schmitt's descriptive analysis but reject pure decisionism." This requires a grounding that Schmitt doesn't provide. Where does the sovereign's authority come from if not mere capacity?

### Serves: Theology (Category II)

**Secularization thesis:** Modern politics is theology in disguise. This cuts both ways: you can recover the theological by unmasking the political, or lose the theological by recognizing it as "merely" political. How you read Schmitt depends on your theological commitments.

**The God question:** If sovereignty mirrors God, what you believe about God shapes what you believe about sovereignty. A personal God who intervenes (miracle) implies a sovereign who decides (exception). A deist God who withdraws implies a constitutional order that runs mechanically.

### Serves: Methodology (Category V)

**Genealogical thinking:** Schmitt's method is genealogical — tracing modern concepts to their theological origins. This is your method too. The excavation of "secularized theological concepts" is Etymon-adjacent.

## Key Passages

> "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception."

> "All significant concepts of the modern doctrine of the state are secularized theological concepts."

> "The exception in jurisprudence is analogous to the miracle in theology."

> "Liberalism... has attempted to transform the enemy... into a debating adversary."

> "Every legal order rests on a decision, not on a norm."

## Authority Status

**Adopted as diagnostic, not normative.**

You use Schmittian analysis: sovereignty, the exception, the friend/enemy distinction. But Schmitt provides diagnosis, not prescription. He tells you what politics *is*; he doesn't tell you what it *should be*.

**The missing piece:** Schmitt is Catholic but his political theology is formal, not substantive. He tells you that political concepts are secularized theology but doesn't say which theology is true. You need to supply that.

**The danger:** Schmittian language can become cynical — "all politics is friend/enemy, so choose your friends wisely." This is true but insufficient. You want transcendent grounding, not just effective decision.

**This source was captured for:**
- `inst-credo-political` (sovereignty, anti-liberalism)
- `inst-credo-theology` (secularization thesis)
- `idx-credo-source-pipeline` (Tier 3 political philosophy)

**This source enables:**
- Grounding your anti-liberal critique theoretically
- Forcing the question: if Schmitt is right descriptively, what grounds sovereignty normatively?
- Connecting political philosophy to theology
