# The National System of Political Economy

**Author:** Friedrich List (1789–1846)
**Year:** 1841
**Type:** Book (political economy)
**Language:** German (original), English translation 1885

---

## Summary

List's central argument: Adam Smith's "cosmopolitan economics" is a theory made by and for already-industrialized nations. It treats all economic activity as equivalent, ignoring the developmental difference between manufacturing and agriculture. A nation that follows Smith's advice to specialize in what it currently does best — if that is agriculture — will remain permanently underdeveloped. Industrialization requires temporary protection.

This matters because it provides the theoretical foundation for **developmental nationalism** — the position that national productive capacity, not free trade, is the basis of wealth and power. List's framework directly informs the American System (Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln) and later developmental states (Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan).

List's critique of Smith is not that free trade is always wrong, but that it is wrong *at the wrong stage*. Free trade between equals benefits both; free trade between an industrial power and an agricultural nation destroys the latter's potential.

---

## Key Claims

1. **The cosmopolitan fallacy:** Smith's economics is "cosmopolitan" — it treats the world as one market and asks what maximizes total utility. But nations exist. A nation that maximizes short-term consumer utility by importing cheap manufactures destroys its long-term productive capacity.

2. **Productive powers vs. exchange values:** Smith focuses on exchange values (prices, trade). List focuses on **productive powers** — the capacity to produce, which includes manufacturing skill, technology, institutions, culture, and infrastructure. These compound over time; exchange values do not.

3. **Stages of development:** Nations pass through stages — savage, pastoral, agricultural, agricultural-manufacturing, agricultural-manufacturing-commercial. Policy appropriate to one stage is disastrous at another. Protection is appropriate during industrialization; free trade is appropriate only between industrial equals.

4. **Infant industry argument:** New industries cannot compete with established foreign industries. They lack scale, skill, and capital. Without temporary protection (tariffs), they die in infancy. Once mature, protection can be removed.

5. **Kicking away the ladder:** Britain industrialized behind high tariffs and government support, then preached free trade to keep other nations agricultural. "It is a very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up."

6. **The nation as unit:** Smith's individual and cosmopolitan frames miss the nation. An individual may prosper from activities that harm the nation (importing cheap goods, exporting raw materials). The nation must foster the welfare of all citizens across generations.

7. **Manufacturing as privileged sector:** Not all economic activity is equal. Manufacturing creates positive externalities — skill development, technological spillovers, urbanization, institutional complexity — that agriculture does not. Specializing in agriculture locks you into poverty.

## Vocabulary

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Cosmopolitan economics** | Smith's framework treating world as one market | What List opposes — ignores national development |
| **National system** | Economics from the perspective of national development | List's alternative framework |
| **Productive powers** | Capacity to produce (skills, technology, institutions) | Compounds over time, unlike exchange values |
| **Exchange values** | Market prices, trade balances | Smith's focus; List says this is superficial |
| **Infant industry** | New manufacturing sector not yet competitive | Requires protection to survive |
| **Kicking away the ladder** | Developed nations preaching free trade after using protection | Hypocrisy of British free-trade advocacy |
| **Stages of development** | Progression from savage to commercial nation | Policy must match stage |

---

## The Stages Theory

| Stage | Character | Appropriate Policy |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Undeveloped** | Subsistence, no trade | Open to all trade to acquire goods |
| **Agrarian** | Cash crop agriculture, exports raw materials | Free trade can work, but risk of lock-in |
| **Industrializing** | Building manufacturing capacity | **Protection required** — infant industries |
| **Industrial** | Mature manufacturing, competitive globally | Free trade with equals; protection from below |

**The critical transition:** Agrarian → Industrializing. This is where nations get stuck. Free trade at this stage imports manufactures, exports raw materials, and prevents manufacturing from developing. Protection breaks the trap.

## Quotable Passages

> "It is a very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him."

The "kicking away the ladder" metaphor — Britain's free-trade hypocrisy.

> "The power of producing wealth is therefore infinitely more important than wealth itself."

Productive powers over exchange values. Capacity compounds; goods do not.

> "Between two nations which are on an equal footing in the development of manufactures, free trade is mutually beneficial."

The condition for free trade — equality of development. Otherwise it's predatory.

> "In opposition to this [cosmopolitan] school there has arisen... the national school, which sees in the nation, in national independence, and in national interests, the conditions and motives of all industrial progress."

Self-description of his project.

## Connections

### Frameworks This Informs

- **Oikonomia vs Chrematistics** — List's "productive powers" is oikonomic (bounded by national development). Smith's "exchange values" is chrematistic (unbounded accumulation). The nation is List's *oikos*.
- **Political Economy Analysis** (proposed) — List provides the developmental/extractive diagnostic criterion.

### Instances This Unlocks

- **American System** — Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln implemented Listian policy before List. He learned from them in America (1825-1832).
- **CAPITAL** — Capital in List's sense is productive capacity (factories, skills), not financial assets. Connects to CAPITAL excavation.
- **WEALTH** — List's view aligns with wealth-as-wela (well-being), not wealth-as-assets.

### Related Sources

- **Hamilton, *Report on Manufactures* (1791)** — American System origin; List cites it. Hamilton argued for protective tariffs before List theorized them.
- **Polanyi, *Great Transformation*** — Complementary. Polanyi on disembedding; List on developmental stages.
- **Ha-Joon Chang, *Kicking Away the Ladder* (2002)** — Contemporary restatement of List's critique; historical evidence.

## Relation to Commitments

From `idx-user-commitments`:

| Commitment | How List Supports |
|------------|-------------------|
| Friedrich List / developmental nationalism | **Core source** — defines the position |
| Protection of infant industries | List's central policy prescription |
| Productive capacity over free trade abstraction | List's "productive powers" vs "exchange values" |
| American System tradition | List learned from Hamilton in America; influenced Clay and Lincoln |
| Skepticism of financialization | List privileges manufacturing over finance |
| Particularity over universalism | List's "national system" vs Smith's "cosmopolitan" |

## Reading Notes

### Preface and Introduction

List identifies two opposed schools: the "cosmopolitan" (Smith, Say) and the "national" (himself). The cosmopolitan school sees individuals and humanity; the national school sees the nation as the necessary unit between individual and world.

He spent time in America (1825-1832) and saw the American System in action. The book is partly a theory of what he observed Americans doing.

### Book I: History

Survey of historical trade policy. Venice, Hanseatic League, Netherlands, England, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Russia, North America. Key observation: every nation that industrialized did so behind protection. England's rise happened through Navigation Acts, tariffs, and state support — not free trade.

### Book II: Theory

The attack on Smith. The "school" (classical economics) commits three errors:
1. Ignores productive powers for exchange values
2. Ignores the nation for individual and world
3. Ignores stages of development for static theory

Manufacturing is privileged because it creates "mental capital" — skills, knowledge, institutions. Agriculture does not compound the same way.

### Book III: Systems

Survey of trade systems: Italian, Hanseatic, English. The English system is the model — protection during development, free trade advocacy after achieving dominance.

### Book IV: Politics

Policy prescriptions. Protection should be:
- Temporary (removed when industry matures)
- Targeted (specific industries, not universal)
- Moderate (enough to compete, not enough to breed inefficiency)

Free trade is appropriate between equals. Protection is appropriate for developing nations against industrial powers.

## For Economic Genealogy

List's contributions:

1. **Productive powers** — The concept that capacity compounds. Connects to CAPITAL (productive vs financial), WEALTH (well-being vs assets).

2. **Stages theory** — Historical progression, not static equilibrium. Connects to genealogical method (how did we get here?).

3. **Nation as oikos** — The nation is List's household. This is oikonomic political economy — bounded by national development, not chrematistic accumulation.

4. **Kicking away the ladder** — The genealogical critique. How nations forget their own developmental history.

His method: take the historical long view. What seems natural (free trade as universal good) is actually recent and contingent — and hypocritical.
