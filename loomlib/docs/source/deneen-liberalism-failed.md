# Why Liberalism Failed

**Author:** Patrick J. Deneen
**Published:** 2018
**Category:** Political Philosophy

## Core Argument

Liberalism has failed not because it was corrupted or improperly implemented, but because it succeeded. Liberalism achieved its goals — individual liberation from all unchosen bonds — and the result is atomization, loneliness, inequality, and the inability to reproduce its own conditions. Liberalism is a victim of its own success.

The failure is not accidental but philosophical. Liberalism's anthropology — the autonomous individual prior to society — is false. Humans are not individuals first and social second; we are constituted by our relations. Liberalism's war on all unchosen attachments (family, place, tradition, religion) destroys the very substrate of human flourishing.

## Key Concepts

### Liberalism as Anti-Culture
- Culture = cultivation; the shaping of persons through inherited forms
- Liberalism defines freedom as liberation from inherited forms
- Therefore liberalism is anti-culture by definition
- It replaces culture with the market and the state

### The Two Liberalisms
- Classical liberalism: limited government, free markets, individual rights
- Progressive liberalism: activist state, identity politics, social justice
- These appear opposed but share the same anthropology
- Both see unchosen attachments as problems to be overcome
- They are two faces of one project

### State and Market as Liberators
- Traditional limits on both state and market came from intermediate institutions
- Family, church, guild, locality — these constrained both
- Liberalism weakened these to liberate the individual
- Result: the individual faces state and market alone
- "Loneliness" is the characteristic liberal experience

### The Anthropological Error
- Liberal anthropology: individuals exist prior to society, then contract to form it
- True anthropology: we are constituted by relationships; the individual is an abstraction
- You are not "autonomous self" first, then member of family, community, nation
- You are son, neighbor, citizen — membership precedes individuality

### Why It "Succeeded" to Failure
- Liberalism promised liberation and delivered it
- But liberation from all bonds is isolation
- Isolation produces loneliness, anomie, despair
- The liberated individual discovers he cannot survive alone
- He then demands the state provide what community once did
- This produces the progressive liberal state — liberalism's completion, not betrayal

### The Sustainability Problem
- Liberalism depends on resources it cannot produce
- Civic virtue, social trust, human capital, children — all come from tradition
- Liberalism consumes this inheritance without replacing it
- Each generation is more liberated and more impoverished
- This is terminal

## Relation to Bedford Credo

### Serves: Political Philosophy (Category VI)

**The post-liberal turn:** Deneen provides the standard contemporary critique of liberalism from a traditionalist-communitarian perspective. Your "post-liberal turn already operative" can cite this.

**Against liberalism (different angle than Schmitt):** Schmitt shows liberalism's theoretical incoherence. Deneen shows its practical destruction. Together they're comprehensive.

**What comes after?** Deneen is vague here — intentionally. He suggests "practices of community" but doesn't propose a new regime. This aligns with your phased approach: destabilize first, propose after.

### Serves: Economics (Category VII)

**The market question:** Deneen criticizes both free-market and progressive liberalism as complicit in atomization. This aligns with your List-oikonomia position: the market should serve community, not dissolve it.

**Against libertarianism:** If you were tempted by free-market conservatism, Deneen blocks that path. Markets liberated from community constraints destroy community.

### Serves: Lineage (Category III)

**The inheritance question:** Deneen insists we are heirs before we are choosers. Your lineage consciousness — 14 generations of Bedfords — is exactly what liberalism cannot accommodate. You didn't choose this identity; you were constituted by it.

## Key Passages

> "Liberalism has failed — not because it fell short, but because it was true to itself."

> "The autonomous individual is not a natural being but a product of a culture that relentlessly promotes autonomy."

> "Liberalism's success has led to its failure."

> "Every liberation from the old unchosen forms of life has been accompanied by new forms of unfreedom."

> "We have inherited a politics of despair, disguised as hope."

## Authority Status

**Potential peer, not just source.**

Deneen is Catholic, communitarian, anti-liberal, pro-tradition. His positions overlap substantially with your commitments. Unlike Evola or Guénon, there's no fundamental metaphysical tension.

**Differences:**
- Deneen is Catholic; you're investigating Orthodoxy
- Deneen is Midwestern; you're Virginia Cavalier
- Deneen offers no clear regime alternative; you might

**The peer question:** Is Deneen a potential contemporary peer? Similar commitments, similar method (genealogical critique), similar posture (critique without premature construction). Worth investigating beyond this text.
