# American Compass and the New Conservatives

**Organization:** American Compass
**Founder:** Oren Cass (2020)
**Type:** Conservative think tank / policy organization
**Key Publication:** "The New Conservatives" (2025)

---

## Summary

American Compass is the institutional center of "New Right" economic policy — explicitly positioning itself as reviving the American System tradition of Hamilton, Clay, and Lincoln against the free-trade consensus that dominated both parties since the 1970s.

Founded in 2020 by Oren Cass (former Romney policy advisor), American Compass represents the intellectual infrastructure for post-neoliberal conservative economics. The organization's founding letter explicitly invokes Henry Clay's "American System" as its model.

**Core thesis:** The globalization and financialization of recent decades have hollowed out American productive capacity. Neither free-market orthodoxy nor progressive redistribution addresses the structural problem. National industrial policy — developmental, protectionist, pro-production — is necessary.

---

## Key Positions

### Industrial Policy

- The U.S. should adopt explicit industrial policy to rebuild domestic manufacturing
- Free trade cannot produce optimal outcomes while competing with state-directed economies (China)
- A development bank or finance corporation is needed for long-term industrial investment
- The American Foundries Act (semiconductor subsidies, defense industrial base) represents the model

### Trade and Tariffs

- Protectionism is legitimate and historically American (not un-American)
- Tariffs should shield infant/strategic industries from foreign competition
- Trade policy should serve national productive capacity, not consumer prices or corporate profits
- Free trade ideology benefits mobile capital at expense of rooted labor and communities

### Labor

- Conservative economics must be "pro-worker" not merely "pro-market"
- Organized labor can be a partner in productive economy (contrast with libertarian anti-union stance)
- Wage levels matter more than GDP growth
- Cass contributed to Project 2025's Department of Labor chapter

### Finance

- Financialization has diverted investment from productive industry
- Wall Street's interests diverge from national interest
- Financial sector's political power must be countered
- Manufacturing is primary; finance should serve it

## The "New Conservatives" (2025)

Fifth anniversary publication consolidating the movement's positions:

**Topics covered:**
- Trade and immigration
- Technology and finance
- Industrial policy
- Education
- Welfare
- Labor
- Family

**Significance:** Wall Street Journal describes American Compass as "the forefront of rethinking traditional conservative economic ideas" — indicating mainstream recognition of the challenge to free-market orthodoxy.

---

## Relation to American System Tradition

American Compass explicitly claims descent from Hamilton-Clay-Lincoln:

| American System | American Compass |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Protective tariffs | Pro-tariff, anti-free-trade |
| National bank for development | Development bank proposal |
| Internal improvements | Infrastructure investment |
| Infant industry protection | Industrial policy for strategic sectors |
| National productive capacity | Manufacturing-first economics |

**The recovery:** American Compass represents the most visible institutional attempt to revive developmental nationalism within mainstream conservatism.

**The limitation:** Still focused on policy rather than institutional building. Think tank model may be insufficient for actual re-founding.

---

## American Affairs Journal

Parallel publication (founded 2017 by Julius Krein) that provides intellectual depth:

**Orientation:** "Neo-Hamiltonian economic nationalism" — technically sophisticated critique of financialization and deindustrialization.

**Key themes:**
- Trade and industrial policy
- Criticisms of financialization
- Family policy and childcare
- Infrastructure
- Bringing together right and left critics of neoliberalism

**Recent coverage (2024-2025):**
- Biden infrastructure spending analysis (where did the money go?)
- Economic statecraft for national security
- Trump tariff policy and "Liberation Day" (April 2025)
- The "two philosophies" of industrial policy

**Significance:** Provides the long-form intellectual content that American Compass translates into policy.

## Strategic Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Explicit American System framing** — connects to historical tradition, not mere improvisation
2. **Institutional form** — think tank, journal, books, events (not just individuals)
3. **Political traction** — contributors include senators, cabinet officials (Lighthizer)
4. **Cross-partisan appeal** — some overlap with left critics of neoliberalism

### Limitations

1. **Think tank model** — produces papers, not institutions
2. **Elite orientation** — targets policy class, not popular movement
3. **Personnel pipeline unclear** — where do developmentalist bureaucrats come from?
4. **Coalition building limited** — how to connect intellectual work to political power beyond Trump orbit?

### Openings

- Vice President JD Vance explicitly aligned (June 2025 New World Gala)
- Project 2025 involvement (for better or worse)
- CHIPS Act, IRA momentum creates policy space
- Bipartisan infrastructure interest

## For Recon

This source informs `inst-recon-institutions-post-globalist`:

**Theory production:** American Compass/American Affairs represent the most developed contemporary theory of developmental nationalism. The gap is not theory but implementation.

**Personnel:** The network around these institutions is the closest thing to a developmentalist personnel pipeline. Key for "where to develop" question.

**Limitation:** Still operating in think tank mode. The American System was built by founders who *did* things (Hamilton as Treasury Secretary, Clay as legislator, Lincoln as President). Can a think tank birth a new arrangement?
