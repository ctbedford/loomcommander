# After Virtue

**Author:** Alasdair MacIntyre
**Published:** 1981
**Category:** Ethics, Political Philosophy

---

## Core Argument

Modern moral philosophy is in a state of grave disorder. We possess fragments of older moral schemes — terms like "virtue," "duty," "rights" — but we have lost the frameworks that made them intelligible. The result is interminable moral disagreement: debates that cannot be resolved because the disputants share no common premises.

The Enlightenment project of grounding morality in universal reason failed. What remains is emotivism — the disguised expression of preference as moral argument. The only way forward is to recover the tradition of the virtues, embedded in practices and communities, that modernity rejected.

## Key Concepts

### The Disorder of Moral Language
- We use moral terms inherited from older frameworks
- But we've lost the frameworks that gave them meaning
- "Rights" made sense in natural law theory; now they're assertions
- "Virtue" made sense in teleological ethics; now it's personal preference
- Moral arguments become interminable because there's no shared standard

### The Enlightenment Project's Failure
- Kant, Hume, Diderot: all tried to ground morality in universal reason
- All failed — each produced a different, incompatible ethics
- The project was doomed: morality without teleology is impossible
- "Ought" requires a purpose; modernity rejected purposes

### Emotivism
- Modern moral statements express preferences disguised as facts
- "X is wrong" means "I disapprove of X; do so as well"
- Moral argument becomes manipulation, not rational persuasion
- The manager and the therapist are characteristic modern figures: both manipulate

### Tradition-Constituted Rationality
- MacIntyre's alternative: rationality is tradition-constituted
- We reason within traditions, not from a view from nowhere
- Traditions can be evaluated: do they solve their internal problems?
- This is not relativism: some traditions are better than others

### Practices, Virtues, Narrative
- **Practices:** complex cooperative activities with internal goods
- **Virtues:** qualities that sustain practices and enable goods
- **Narrative:** human life as a quest with beginning, middle, end
- Virtues make sense only within practices embedded in narratives within traditions

### The Monastic Option
- Famous closing passage: we await "a new — doubtless very different — St. Benedict"
- When the Roman Empire collapsed, monasteries preserved civilization
- Perhaps our task is similar: build local communities of virtue
- Not political revolution but cultural preservation

## Relation to Bedford Credo

### Serves: Ethics (Category V)

**The virtue tradition:** MacIntyre recovers what you need — an ethics of virtue embedded in community and tradition, not abstract rules or individual choice.

**Against emotivism:** Your ethical positions are not preferences but claims about human flourishing. MacIntyre shows why modern ethics can't recognize this.

**Ilyin compatibility:** Ilyin says bear the sin and act. MacIntyre says virtues enable right action within traditions. These complement: the virtuous person has the character to bear what Ilyin describes.

### Serves: Political Philosophy (Category VI)

**The tradition question:** MacIntyre's "tradition-constituted rationality" grounds your rejection of liberal universalism. Reason is not neutral; it's formed by traditions.

**The new Benedict:** Your strategic posture — phased approach, building before openly contesting — resonates with the monastic option. Build communities of practice; the alternative to liberalism will emerge from them.

**Against liberalism:** MacIntyre diagnoses liberalism as itself a tradition that pretends it isn't. This is devastating: liberalism's claim to neutrality is false.

### Serves: Epistemology (Category IV)

**Four knowings connection:** MacIntyre's account of practices requires procedural and perspectival knowing, not just propositional. You learn virtue by doing, within a tradition. This aligns with Vervaeke's critique of propositional over-emphasis.

**Narrative identity:** You are not an autonomous individual choosing a life but a character in a narrative you didn't author. The Bedford lineage is such a narrative.

### Serves: Lineage (Category III)

**Tradition as gift:** You inherit a tradition (Virginia Cavalier, Bedford) that constitutes you. MacIntyre says this is how all persons are constituted — by the narratives they're born into.

## Key Passages

> "We possess indeed simulacra of morality, we continue to use many of the key expressions. But we have — very largely, if not entirely — lost our comprehension, both theoretical and practical, of morality."

> "The Enlightenment project of justifying morality had to fail... because it was committed to the rejection of Aristotelianism."

> "I am someone's son or daughter, someone else's cousin or uncle; I am a citizen of this or that city, a member of this or that guild or profession; I belong to this clan, that tribe, this nation."

> "What matters at this stage is the construction of local forms of community within which civility and the intellectual and moral life can be sustained through the new dark ages which are already upon us."

## Authority Status

**Near-authority, potential peer.**

MacIntyre's method is genealogical. His diagnosis of modernity is compatible with yours. His recovery of virtue-in-tradition aligns with your commitments. He is Catholic (converted from Marxism), which creates slight tension with your Orthodox investigation — but less than Evola or Guénon.

**Living thinker:** MacIntyre is still alive (b. 1929). This is a contemporary conversation, not just source capture.

**The peer question:** MacIntyre is more established (major philosopher) but the overlap is significant. His students (like Deneen) are even closer peers.
