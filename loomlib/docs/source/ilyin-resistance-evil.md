# On Resistance to Evil by Force

**Author:** Ivan Ilyin
**Published:** 1925
**Category:** Ethics, Political Theology

---

## Core Argument

The question is not whether Christians may use force — that is already answered by history and necessity. The question is how to use force without moral self-destruction, and how to bear the spiritual burden of necessary violence.

Tolstoyan non-resistance is not merely impractical but spiritually irresponsible. It refuses to bear the moral weight of the world. True Christian ethics demands action even when action involves sin — and then confession, repentance, and grace.

## Key Concepts

### The False Dilemma
- Tolstoy poses: either absolute non-resistance or hypocrisy
- Ilyin rejects this: the alternatives are not purity and sin
- The real choice: bear sin responsibly or abandon the world to evil
- Inaction is not purity — it is abdication

### The Tragedy of Action
- All action in a fallen world involves compromise with evil
- To govern is to make impossible choices
- To defend the innocent may require harming the aggressor
- The statesman cannot have clean hands
- This is not justification of evil but acknowledgment of tragedy

### The Spiritual Solution
- Act in good conscience toward the good
- Bear the sin consciously — do not deny or rationalize
- Confess, repent, receive grace
- Act again
- This is not license but discipline

### The Sword-Bearer
- The one who wields force bears a spiritual burden
- He must not enjoy it, must not harden
- He must preserve his own soul while doing necessary things
- The warrior needs spiritual discipline more, not less, than the monk

### Against Tolstoyanism
- Tolstoy's non-resistance is aristocratic luxury
- It requires someone else to do the dirty work
- It abandons the weak to predators
- It is spiritual pride disguised as humility
- Real holiness faces the world's evil and acts

## Relation to Bedford Credo

### Serves: Ethics (Category V)

**The core principle you quote:**
> "I would rather bear my sin to act in good intention than to not act in fear that I am in violation of the sacred."

This is pure Ilyin. The position that action is preferable to paralysis, that stewardship requires deployment, that inaction is also sin — all come from or resonate with this text.

**Red lines question:** Ilyin does not say all force is justified. The question remains: what are the limits? Where does "bearing sin" become "rationalizing evil"? This is the tension you need to resolve in `inst-credo-ethics`.

### Serves: Political Philosophy (Category VI)

**The statesman's burden:** Those who govern bear sins that private persons avoid. This is not corruption but the nature of the office. Political theology must account for this.

**Against liberal universalism:** Liberal ethics assumes clean hands are possible. Ilyin (like Schmitt, like Weber) insists they are not. The choice is not between good and evil but between forms of responsibility.

### Serves: Anthropology (Category III)

**The Warrior archetype:** Ilyin provides theological grounding for the Warrior. The warrior is not morally inferior to the contemplative — he bears a different burden. This addresses the Magician-Warrior imbalance from a spiritual angle.

## Key Passages

> "He who refuses to resist evil by force arrives not at 'non-participation in evil' but at complicity in the universal victory of evil."

> "The struggle with evil is a spiritual struggle first of all; but it may demand the use of physical force."

> "The one who wields the sword for the sake of righteousness must bear the spiritual burden of his deed... He must never harden, never become cruel, never lose sight of the higher purpose."

> "To kill the murderer in the act of murder is not murder; it is defense of the innocent. But it is still killing, and the one who kills must know what he has done."

## Authority Status

**Adopted authority.**

You quote Ilyin's principle as if it were your own. This source document captures the text behind the principle. Ilyin is not "interesting" or "engaged" — he provides the ethical frame you already operate within.

**Controversial context:** Ilyin is associated with contemporary Russian politics. This is irrelevant to the philosophical content. Evaluate the argument on its merits.

**The Orthodox answer:** Ilyin was Orthodox. His ethics presupposes Orthodox sacramental life — confession and absolution make the cycle of action-sin-grace-action possible. This connects to the ecclesiology question.

## Composition

**This source was captured for:**
- `inst-credo-ethics` (the principle you quote, red lines question)

- `idx-credo-source-pipeline` (Tier 1 blocking source)

**This source enables:**
- Grounding the ethical position you already hold
- Connecting ethics to ecclesiology (confession as necessary complement)
- Addressing the Warrior question spiritually
