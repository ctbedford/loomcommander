# Report on the Subject of Manufactures

**Author:** Alexander Hamilton (1755/57–1804)
**Year:** 1791 (December 5)
**Type:** Government report (third of Hamilton's four major reports as Treasury Secretary)
**Context:** Submitted to Congress at request of House of Representatives

---

## Summary

Hamilton's central argument: The United States must develop manufacturing capacity to achieve true independence from Britain. Agriculture alone cannot secure national prosperity or security. Manufacturing requires active government support because established foreign competitors have insurmountable advantages over new domestic industries.

This matters because it is the **origin of the American System** — the developmental nationalist tradition that would be carried forward by Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln, and the Republican Party. Friedrich List learned from American practice during his time in the US (1825-1832) and systematized what Hamilton had already implemented.

Hamilton's Report is developmental economics before the term existed — the argument that national industrial capacity must be deliberately built through policy, not left to market forces that favor already-industrialized competitors.

## Key Claims

1. **Manufacturing is necessary for independence:** "Not only the wealth, but the independence and security of a Country, appear to be materially connected with the prosperity of manufactures." Reliance on foreign manufactures leaves the nation vulnerable.

2. **Agriculture alone is insufficient:** The Physiocratic doctrine that only agriculture is productive is "rather subtil and paradoxical, than solid or convincing." Manufacturing creates value; the division of labor increases productivity.

3. **Manufacturing and agriculture are complementary:** "The aggregate prosperity of manufactures, and the aggregate prosperity of agriculture are intimately connected." Manufacturing creates demand for agricultural products. Regional specialization strengthens the union.

4. **Infant industry argument:** Established foreign industries have insurmountable advantages — skill, capital, reputation. "To maintain competition between recent establishments of one country and long-matured establishments of another country upon equal terms, both as to quality and price, is in most cases impracticable." New industries need temporary protection.

5. **Labor is not scarce but misallocated:** Manufacturing would employ women, children, and immigrants not currently in the agricultural workforce. "It is worthy of particular remark, that, in general, women and children are rendered more useful... by manufacturing establishments, than they would otherwise be."

6. **Machines compensate for labor scarcity:** "The substitution of machines for human labour" addresses the supposed labor shortage. Technology enables development.

7. **Government must act:** Private capital will not naturally flow to manufacturing because returns are uncertain and foreign competition is fierce. Bounties (subsidies) and protective duties are necessary to establish industries.

## Policy Proposals

Hamilton proposed eleven specific measures:

| Measure | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Protective duties (tariffs)** | Shield infant industries from foreign competition |
| **Prohibitions on competing imports** | Stronger protection for critical industries |
| **Prohibitions on export of raw materials** | Keep inputs available for domestic manufacture |
| **Bounties (subsidies)** | Direct government support for new manufactures |
| **Premiums (prizes)** | Rewards for achievement in manufacturing |
| **Exemption of materials from duty** | Reduce costs for manufacturers |
| **Drawbacks (rebates)** | Refund duties on imported materials used in exports |
| **Encouragement of inventions** | Patent protection and rewards for innovation |
| **Inspection regulations** | Quality standards to build reputation |
| **Facilitating remittances and transportation** | Internal improvements and financial infrastructure |
| **A Bank of the United States** | Provide capital for manufacturing ventures |

**Hamilton's nuance on tariffs:** He actually preferred bounties (subsidies) to high tariffs. Bounties encourage manufacturing without raising consumer prices. Tariffs can create scarcity and hurt consumers. But political reality often made tariffs more feasible.

## Industries Identified

Hamilton identified specific industries for development:

| Industry | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Iron and steel** | Foundation for tools, machines, weapons |
| **Copper** | Essential metal |
| **Lead** | Multiple uses |
| **Fossil coal** | Energy independence |
| **Wood** | Abundant domestic resource |
| **Skins** | Leather goods |
| **Grain** | Processing domestic agriculture |
| **Flax and hemp** | Rope, canvas, textiles |
| **Cotton** | Textiles (prophetic — cotton would dominate) |
| **Wool** | Textiles |
| **Silk** | Luxury textiles |
| **Glass** | Manufactures |
| **Gunpowder** | National security |
| **Paper** | Essential for commerce and culture |
| **Printed books** | Independence of mind |
| **Refined sugars** | Processing imported raw materials |

## Vocabulary

| Term | Definition | Significance |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Bounty** | Government subsidy to producers | Hamilton's preferred tool — supports without raising prices |
| **Protecting duty** | Tariff to shield domestic industry | The infant industry mechanism |
| **Drawback** | Refund of import duties on re-exported goods | Supports manufacturing for export |
| **Infant industry** | New domestic industry not yet competitive | The core concept — needs protection to mature |
| **Internal improvements** | Transportation and infrastructure | Enables national market |
| **Division of labor** | Specialization increasing productivity | Why manufacturing is productive |

## Response to Objections

Hamilton addressed the main arguments against his proposals:

### "Agriculture is the only productive labor"

Hamilton rejected the Physiocratic doctrine. Manufacturing creates value through transformation. The division of labor multiplies productivity. "It is not certain that [agriculture] would not, in a Society where there was a full employment for every person...add much more to the Revenue of the Society, than it is commonly computed."

### "Manufacturing hurts agriculture"

The opposite is true. "Mutual wants constitute one of the strongest links of political connection." Manufacturing creates demand for agricultural products. The regions become interdependent.

### "Labor is too scarce and expensive"

Manufacturing employs those not in agriculture — women, children, immigrants. Machines compensate for labor scarcity. The problem is not lack of labor but lack of manufacturing employment.

### "Capital will not flow to manufacturing"

This is precisely why government must act. Private capital seeks safe returns. Manufacturing is risky against established foreign competition. Government support makes investment rational.

## Historical Outcome

| Event | Year | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Report submitted | 1791 | Congress rejects most proposals due to Jeffersonian opposition |
| Gradual adoption | 1790s-1810s | Tariffs slowly increased; some bounties enacted |
| War of 1812 | 1812-1815 | British blockade proves Hamilton right — dependence is dangerous |
| Tariff of 1816 | 1816 | First explicitly protective tariff; manufacturing surge |
| Henry Clay's American System | 1820s | Systematizes Hamilton's vision — tariffs, bank, internal improvements |
| Lincoln and Republicans | 1860s | Full implementation; rapid industrialization |
| 20th century | — | US becomes world's largest industrial power |

**The vindication:** Nearly all of Hamilton's recommendations were eventually adopted. The US industrialized behind tariff walls, then (like Britain before) preached free trade from a position of dominance.

## Connections

### Frameworks This Informs

- **Oikonomia vs Chrematistics** — Hamilton's vision is oikonomic: the nation is the household; manufacturing serves national flourishing, not unlimited accumulation. Independence and security, not just wealth.
- **Political Economy Analysis** (proposed) — Hamilton provides the American origin of developmental/extractive criterion.

### Sources This Informs

- **List, *National System*** — List visited America 1825-1832 and saw Hamilton's system in practice. He theorized what Hamilton had done. List explicitly cites American policy as his model.

### Instances This Unlocks

- **American System** — Clay's explicit development of Hamilton's program
- **CAPITAL** — Hamilton's "capital" is productive capacity (factories, skills, infrastructure), not financial assets
- **INTEREST** — Hamilton's Bank as instrument of national development, not private accumulation

### Related Sources

- **List, *National System of Political Economy* (1841)** — The theoretical systematization of Hamiltonian practice
- **Clay, American System speeches** — Policy implementation
- **Lincoln, economic addresses** — Republican adoption

## Relation to Commitments

From `idx-user-commitments`:

| Commitment | How Hamilton Supports |
|------------|----------------------|
| American System tradition (Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln) | **Origin source** — Hamilton founded it |
| Friedrich List / developmental nationalism | List learned from Hamilton; theorized American practice |
| Protection of infant industries | Hamilton's central policy argument |
| Productive capacity over free trade abstraction | Hamilton: manufacturing capacity is independence |
| Skepticism of financialization | Hamilton's Bank serves industry, not speculation |
| Oikonomia vs chrematistics | National flourishing and security, not unlimited accumulation |

## The Hamilton-List Connection

| Hamilton (1791) | List (1841) | Relationship |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Infant industry argument | Infant industry argument | Same concept; List learned from American practice |
| Bounties and tariffs | Protection during industrialization | Same policy tools |
| Manufacturing vs agriculture | Productive powers vs exchange values | Same insight about manufacturing's special role |
| National independence | National system | Same frame — the nation as unit |
| Practical policy | Theoretical system | Hamilton did it; List explained why it works |

List spent seven years in America (1825-1832) and saw the American System operating. He wrote: "I perceived that the theory was not in line with practice." His *National System* is the theory of what Hamilton practiced.

## Quotable Passages

> "Not only the wealth, but the independence and security of a Country, appear to be materially connected with the prosperity of manufactures."

Manufacturing is not just economic but strategic.

> "To maintain competition between recent establishments of one country and long-matured establishments of another country upon equal terms, both as to quality and price, is in most cases impracticable."

The infant industry argument — why free trade hurts developing nations.

> "The aggregate prosperity of manufactures, and the aggregate prosperity of agriculture are intimately connected."

Manufacturing and agriculture complement, not compete.

> "It is worthy of particular remark, that, in general, women and children are rendered more useful... by manufacturing establishments, than they would otherwise be."

Manufacturing creates employment for those outside agriculture.
