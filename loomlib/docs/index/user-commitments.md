# User Commitments

**Purpose:** Calibration document for all loomlib operations. This index defines the telos against which frameworks are selected, peers are matched, and outputs are evaluated.

**Usage:** Every loomlib command should discover this document first. Commitments here override type-matching. Surface-feature peers who conflict with these commitments should be flagged as "method-similar, telos-divergent."

---

## I. Political Economy

| Commitment | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Friedrich List / developmental nationalism | Core | Explicit identification, American System |
| Protection of infant industries | Core | Follows from List |
| Productive capacity over free trade abstraction | Core | National development over Ricardian logic |
| Oikonomia vs chrematistics distinction | Core | Bounded flourishing vs unlimited accumulation |
| Skepticism of financialization | Core | Chrematistics critique |
| American System tradition (Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln) | Core | Historical identification |
| Anti-globalist (in the Listian sense) | Likely | Follows from developmental nationalism |

**Potential Peers:** Michael Lind, Ha-Joon Chang, Patrick Deneen (economic critique portions), American Affairs orbit

**Anti-Peers:** Illich (anti-institutional where you're pro-developmental-state), free-trade liberals, anarcho-capitalists

---

## II. Traditionalism / Metaphysics

| Commitment | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Guénon (perennial philosophy, critique of modernity) | Engaged | NotebookLLM sources, explicit references |
| Evola (initiatic memory, Ride the Tiger, hierarchy) | Engaged | Explicit requests, serious reading |
| Traditionalism as "live option" | Declared | Not endorsement, but serious engagement |
| Critique of Enlightenment universalism | Core | "What if Enlightenment was wrong?" |
| Legitimate hierarchy based on transcendent order | Core | Explicit statement |
| Anti-egalitarianism (metaphysical, not just political) | Likely | Follows from traditionalist engagement |
| Bergson's temporal metaphysics | Engaged | Referenced in intellectual formation |
| Dugin / Land convergence interest | Curious | Reading, not necessarily committed |

**Unresolved Question:** Where do you land on the Christian vs. perennialist vs. pagan-sympathetic axis? The Cavalier heritage is Anglican. The traditionalists split here. Peterson is vaguely Christian-archetypal. This matters.

**Potential Peers:** None clean. The traditionalists (Guénon, Evola, Schuon) are the reference class. Living: Bronze Age Pervert orbit aesthetically but not substantively? Yarvin shares anti-universalism but different conclusions.

**Anti-Peers:** Vervaeke (syncretist where you're lineage-conscious), secular humanists, Enlightenment universalists

---

## III. Lineage / Heritage

| Commitment | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Virginia Cavalier identification | Core | 14-generation genealogy documented |
| William Bedford (1621 Jamestown) as origin | Documented | Explicit research |
| Frontier Gentry values | Core | Self-identification |
| "Bedfordsonian" synthesis | Constructing | Your own framework name |
| Particularity over rootless cosmopolitanism | Core | Explicit contrast |
| Duty to ancestors and posterity | Core | Explicit articulation |
| Lineage consciousness as epistemological | Core | Not nostalgia—operative |

**The Bedford Pattern:**
- William Bedford: Act without framework
- Capt. Stephen: Build institutions (first sheriff)
- Col. Thomas: Lead in crisis (Committee of Safety)
- Gunning Jr.: Present at creation, served refugees
- Generation 14 (you): Unwritten

**Potential Peers:** Very few. This is particular. Deneen maybe? MacIntyre on tradition-constituted rationality?

**Anti-Peers:** McLuhan (Catholic universalist where you're particular), rootless cosmopolitans, those who treat tradition as resource rather than inheritance

---

## IV. Psychology / Development

| Commitment | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Jungian archetypal psychology | Core | KWML, shadow work, consistent vocabulary |
| KWML framework (King, Warrior, Magician, Lover) | Core | Self-diagnosis tool |
| Magician-Warrior imbalance (90/10) | Self-diagnosed | Core developmental challenge |
| Integration through action, not further abstraction | Stated goal | Recognition of the problem |
| Peterson's Genesis lectures (formative, 17-18) | Formative | Entry point to Jung, archetypes |
| Vervaeke's Meaning Crisis (formative, 20-21) | Formative | 4E cognition, participatory knowing, genealogical map |
| Relevance realization | Adopted | From Vervaeke |
| Four kinds of knowing (propositional, procedural, perspectival, participatory) | Adopted | From Vervaeke, explicitly used |
| Participatory knowing as goal | Core | Not just propositional understanding |

**Developmental Edge:** The Magician-Warrior imbalance is the live challenge. Framework proliferation without shipping is the symptom. Etymon Episode 1 is the test.

**Potential Peers:** Robert Moore (KWML originator), Assagioli (will integration). Question: who shares your application of these frameworks to development?

**Note:** Peterson and Vervaeke are teachers, not peers. You learned from them. The question is whether you share their telos or have moved beyond them.

## V. Methodology / Epistemology

| Commitment | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Philological excavation (Etymon Method) | Core | Original method, produces instances |
| Etymology as archaeology, not trivia | Core | Language carries operational capacity |
| Degraded terms can be recovered | Core | The Etymon premise |
| Recovery for application, not nostalgia | Core | Excavation → drift → recovery |
| Methods as first-class knowledge | Core | Loomlib architecture |
| AI as compositional instrument | Core | Not assistant—instrument for production |
| Production over capture | Core | Loomlib design principle |
| Genealogical thinking ("how did we get here") | Core | From Vervaeke, applied broadly |
| Conducting frontmatter (tracking production flow) | Original | Loomlib innovation |
| Diagnostic frames (by capacity, acquisition, aspect, granularity, knowing type) | Original | Your architecture |

**Potential Peers:** The Strauss school (esoteric reading)? Weinstein brothers (sense-making, but different commitments)?

**Surface-Match Anti-Peers:** Illich (philological attention but anti-institutional politics), McLuhan (media ecology but universalist orientation)

---

## VI. Formative Influences (Teachers, Not Peers)

| Figure | Relationship | What You Took |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Jordan Peterson | Teacher (17-18) | Jung entry, archetypal reading of narrative, personal responsibility |
| John Vervaeke | Teacher (20-21) | 4E cognition, participatory knowing, genealogical method, meaning crisis diagnosis |
| Carl Jung | Source | Archetypes, shadow, individuation |
| Friedrich List | Adopted authority | Political economy framework |
| Guénon | Engaged authority | Traditionalist critique, but not fully adopted? |
| Evola | Engaged authority | Ride the Tiger, initiatic memory, but not fully adopted? |
| Your father (Chris Bedford) | Operative model | Working alongside, COO at Pathformance |
| The Bedford ancestors | Inherited pattern | Institution-building, crisis leadership, frontier action |

---

## VII. Current Operative Commitments

| Commitment | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Northwest Arkansas as terrain | Fixed | Location, local capacity |
| Pathformance (4-person company with father) | Active | Professional context |
| PathX (campaign analysis, 400+ brands) | Built | Technical achievement |
| Self-taught full-stack development | Identity | How you learned to build |
| CIVITAS / BeeSafe (90-day validation sprint) | Active | Autonomous security robot for HOAs |
| Etymon (YouTube channel) | Intended | Not yet shipped |
| Loomlib (knowledge management system) | Built | 78 documents, 22+ commands |
| The Curriculum (four tracks) | In progress | Philosophical genealogy (complete), Linguistic recovery (in progress), Economic genealogy (next), Legal grammar (parallel) |

---

## VIII. Anti-Commitments (What You're Against)

| Position | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Unbounded growth / infinite accumulation | Oikonomia critique |
| Rootless cosmopolitanism | Lineage consciousness contrast |
| Universalist synthesis that ignores particularity | Traditionalist critique |
| Liberal democracy as final form | Explicit ("what if Enlightenment was wrong?") |
| AI as replacement rather than augmentation | Compositional instrument model |
| Authority derived from consent alone | Transcendent order preference |
| Modernity's de-souling of the cosmos | Vervaeke + traditionalist convergence |

---

## IX. Strategic Posture

| Position | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Prudence in current conditions | Explicit ("what's the point of talking about return when conditions aren't set?") |
| Phase 1: Destabilize liberal premises from within | Stated |
| Phase 2: Make unspeakable first speakable, then thinkable | Stated |
| Phase 3: Offer alternative when ready | Stated |
| "Establish the canvas on the social easel first" | Exact words |
| Joining the system "when the moment is germane" | Stated |
| "Honoring the past while meeting the present" | Stated |
| New forms that embody old principles | Goal |

## X. The Unresolved Questions

1. **The Christian question.** Anglican heritage, Peterson's vague Christianity, traditionalist perennialism, Evola's paganism — where do you actually land?

2. **Peterson and Vervaeke as teachers vs. peers.** You learned from them. Do you share their telos, or have you moved beyond them?

3. **Evola/Guénon: engaged or committed?** "Live option" is careful language. Are they sources you read, or authorities you follow?

4. **The Straussians.** Esoteric reading, American regime focus, writing between the lines — relevant to your posture? Or different tradition?

5. **Who are your actual contemporary peers?** Not teachers, not historical figures — people alive now doing similar work from similar commitments?

## Calibration Protocol

When any loomlib command produces output involving the user:

### Peer Matching
1. Check commitments before surface features
2. Flag "method-similar, telos-divergent" peers explicitly
3. Prefer peers who share political economy and lineage consciousness, not just methodology

### Framework Selection
1. Prefer frameworks that serve stated commitments
2. When frameworks conflict with commitments, note the tension
3. The Magician-Warrior imbalance is live — prefer frameworks that produce action over abstraction

### Assessment Criteria
1. Does this output help ship Etymon Episode 1?
2. Does this reinforce the Magician trap or break it?
3. Is this production or elaborate capture?

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
1. Matching on philological method → Illich (different politics)
2. Matching on synthesis → Vervaeke (different particularity)
3. Matching on system-building → Victor (different telos)
4. Validating from within the system rather than against external criteria
