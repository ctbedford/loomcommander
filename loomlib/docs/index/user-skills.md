# User Skills

**Purpose:** Calibration document for loomlib operations. This index defines *capacity* (what you can do) to complement `idx-user-commitments` (what you're committed to). Together they answer: "Given what I want, what can I actually execute?"

**Usage:** Commands that involve assessment, planning, or production should check both documents. Skills here inform:
- What's actionable now vs. needs development
- Where the Magician-Warrior gap manifests in capacity
- Which frameworks you can apply vs. only understand

**Framework:** Skills organized by the Four Knowings (Vervaeke), used operationally while acknowledging its limits (see `inst-apologetic-four-knowings`).

## I. Technical Skills (Procedural)

### Software Development

| Skill | Level | Evidence | Commitment Served |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| TypeScript/JavaScript | Fluent | PathX, Loomlib, Minwrite | Loomcommander output |
| React | Fluent | PathX UI | Loomcommander output |
| Node.js | Fluent | Backend systems | Loomcommander output |
| Python | Working | Jira scripts, automation | Tooling |
| SQL/Databases | Working | PathX analytics | PathX/BeeSafe |
| Git/Version Control | Fluent | Daily use | All production |
| Vite/Build Tools | Working | Loomlib, Minwrite | Loomcommander output |

**Self-taught pattern:** Learn by building, not courses. This is procedural knowing acquired through practice.

### AI/LLM Integration

| Skill | Level | Evidence | Commitment Served |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Prompt engineering | Developing | Loomlib commands, Claude orchestration | AI as instrument |
| Claude Code workflows | Developing | This system | Loomcommander output |
| MCP/tool integration | Basic | Chrome extension integration | Loomcommander output |

**Gap:** Not yet shipping AI-augmented products to customers. BeeSafe could be the test.

### Video/Media Production

| Skill | Level | Evidence | Commitment Served |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Video editing | Untested | None shipped | Etymon output (BLOCKED) |
| Audio production | Untested | None shipped | Etymon output (BLOCKED) |
| Graphic design | Basic | Some PathX work | Etymon output |
| Writing/scripting | Strong | Loomlib content, frameworks | Etymon output |

**Critical gap:** 35 Etymon documents exist. Zero videos. This is the Magician-Warrior test.

---

## II. Intellectual Skills (Propositional + Perspectival)

### Frameworks Mastered (Can Apply)

| Framework | Knowing Type | Evidence | Status |
|-----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Etymon Method | Procedural | Multiple excavations produced | Verified |
| Survey Method | Procedural | Multiple surveys completed | Verified |
| Scope Method | Procedural | Multiple scopes completed | Draft |
| Oikonomia/Chrematistics | Perspectival | Shapes economic analysis | Verified |
| Agonal Identity | Perspectival | Shapes political analysis | Verified |
| Four Knowings | Perspectival | Used but under critique | Verified |
| KWML | Perspectival | Self-diagnosis tool | Adopted |

### Frameworks Known (Propositional Only)

| Framework | Source | Gap |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| List's developmental economics | Reading | Not yet applied to real policy analysis |
| Traditionalist critique | Guénon, Evola | Engaged but not committed; axis unresolved |
| Legal grammar | Not started | Curriculum track missing |

**Pattern:** Strong on propositional (knowing that), developing on procedural (knowing how), weaker on participatory (knowing through belonging).

### Research Skills

| Skill | Level | Evidence |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Etymological research | Strong | Excavations |
| Codebase investigation | Strong | Surveys |
| Source synthesis | Strong | Source documents, recons |
| Genealogical thinking | Developing | Apologetics, economic genealogy |
| Primary source reading | Developing | Aristotle, Graeber, etc. |

---

## III. Business/Operative Skills (Procedural + Participatory)

### Current Context: Pathformance

| Skill | Level | Evidence |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Campaign analytics | Expert | 400+ brands analyzed |
| Data visualization | Strong | PathX dashboards |
| Client communication | Working | COO role alongside father |
| Product management | Developing | PathX iteration |

### Entrepreneurial

| Skill | Level | Evidence | Gap |
|-------|-------|----------|-----|
| Technical building | Strong | PathX, Loomlib | — |
| Market validation | Untested | BeeSafe is the test | 90-day sprint |
| Sales/BD | Untested | None | Critical for BeeSafe |
| Customer discovery | Untested | None | Critical for BeeSafe |

**The Warrior test:** Technical building is Magician territory. Sales, validation, customer work is Warrior territory. The imbalance is visible here.

## IV. The Knowing Gap Analysis

Using Four Knowings diagnostically:

| Knowing Type | Current State | Commitment Tension |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Propositional** | Strong — frameworks, vocabulary, genealogies | Risk: accumulation without application |
| **Procedural** | Developing — can execute methods, build software | Gap: video production, sales |
| **Perspectival** | Developing — see through oikonomia, agonal lenses | Gap: legal grammar perspective missing |
| **Participatory** | Weak — lineage claimed but not enacted; no initiatic belonging | Critical: the apologetic surfaces this |

**The honest assessment:** You know *that* a lot. You're learning *how* to apply it. You're developing *what* to see. You haven't yet become *who* — the participatory knowing that comes from shipping, from community, from being received into something.

---

## V. Skill-Commitment Alignment

### Aligned (Skills Match Commitments)

| Commitment | Skill | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| AI as compositional instrument | Prompt engineering, Claude workflows | Developing |
| Loomcommander output | TypeScript, React, system building | Strong |
| Etymon Method | Philological research, framework application | Strong |
| Production over capture | Survey/Scope/Excavate methods | Strong |

### Misaligned (Commitments Outrun Skills)

| Commitment | Missing Skill | Impact |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Etymon (YouTube) | Video production | 35 docs, 0 videos |
| BeeSafe/CIVITAS | Sales, customer discovery | Business validation blocked |
| Legal grammar curriculum | Legal reading/drafting | Curriculum track missing |
| Participatory knowing | Initiation, belonging | The apologetic's finding |

### The Magician-Warrior Map

| Activity | Type | Current Capacity |
|----------|------|------------------|
| Framework creation | Magician | Strong (14 frameworks) |
| Excavation/research | Magician | Strong (38 research docs) |
| System design | Magician | Strong (Loomlib) |
| Video shipping | Warrior | Blocked |
| Customer conversations | Warrior | Untested |
| Sales | Warrior | Untested |
| Finishing | Warrior | The developmental edge |

---

## VI. Development Priorities

Based on commitment-skill gap analysis:

### Immediate (Unblocks Current Projects)

| Skill | Why | How |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Video production workflow | Unblocks Etymon Episode 1 | Define MVE, learn tools, ship one |
| Customer discovery | Unblocks BeeSafe validation | 10 customer conversations |

### Foundational (Fills Curriculum Gaps)

| Skill | Why | How |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Legal reading | Missing curriculum track | Start with Blackstone or constitutional law |
| Sales basics | Warrior development | Books, practice, BeeSafe as training ground |

### Integration (Magician-Warrior Balance)

| Pattern | Shift |
|---------|-------|
| "Research before acting" | Invert: act before fully researching |
| "One more framework" | Stop: ship with current frameworks |
| "Understand first" | Limit: understanding is never complete |

---

## VII. Calibration Protocol

When any loomlib command involves the user:

### Skill Check
1. Does this task require skills the user has?
2. If not, flag the gap explicitly
3. Distinguish propositional knowing (can discuss) from procedural (can do)

### Warrior Test
1. Is this task Magician (research, framework, understanding) or Warrior (shipping, selling, finishing)?
2. If Magician, ask: does this serve a Warrior outcome?
3. If pure Magician, flag: "This may reinforce the imbalance"

### Participatory Caution
1. Does this task claim participatory knowing the user hasn't earned?
2. Particularly: "belonging to" traditions, communities, lineages
3. The apologetic on Four Knowings is live context here

---

## VIII. Anti-Skills (What Not to Develop)

| Temptation | Why Resist |
|------------|------------|
| More frameworks | 14 exist; ship instances |
| Deeper research before acting | The Magician trap |
| Abstract methodology | Loomlib works; use it |
| Peer-matching based on method | Commitments override surface features |
| "Ecology of practices" thinking | The domesticated version of participatory knowing |
