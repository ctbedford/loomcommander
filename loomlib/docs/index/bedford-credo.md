# The Bedford Credo

**Ten categories. Ten commitments. The substrate from which all action emerges.**

> "I did not write my worldview, but I could have stated every position instantly if asked. They were mine — not borrowed, not tentative, not 'interesting perspectives.' Owned."
> — Lee Kuan Yew (constructed dialogue)

---

## Purpose

This index collects the ten worldview commitments that constitute the Bedford Confession. Each category links to an instance document containing:

1. **The position held** — not tentative, but as commitment
2. **The grounds** — why this position, not another
3. **The tensions carried** — unresolved questions that remain
4. **The downstream implications** — what this commits us to

The credo is not finished until each position can be stated instantly, without hesitation, as conviction rather than theory.

## The Ten Categories

### Status Legend

| Symbol | State | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| ◉ | Owned | Conviction, not theory. Can state instantly. |
| ◐ | Articulated | Position clear, but tensions unresolved |
| ◔ | Engaged | Exploring seriously, not yet committed |
| ○ | Implicit | Position held but not yet articulated |
| ◇ | Unresolved | No clear position yet |

---

### I. Metaphysics: What Is Real?

**Status:** ◐ Articulated, scattered
**Document:** `inst-credo-metaphysics`
**Action Required:** Consolidate into one paragraph

**Current Position (scattered):**
- Reality is hierarchical — material, psychic, spiritual levels
- Experienced ontological evil, deduced ontological good
- The material world is real but not ultimate
- Engages Traditionalist metaphysics (Guénon, Evola) seriously
- Bergson's temporal metaphysics influences — process and duration over static being

**Tension:** Is reality hierarchical (Traditionalist/Neoplatonic) or sacramental (Christian — matter infused with spirit, not inferior to it)?

---

### II. Theology: Who Is God?

**Status:** ◐ Strong, with tension
**Document:** `inst-credo-theology`
**Action Required:** Resolve Christ's uniqueness

**Current Position:**
- Christ confessed as Lord and Savior (explicit, from encounter)
- The Incarnation as real historical event
- Grace over works, but not passive — Ilyin's "bear the sin to act"
- Trinitarian Christianity (implicit from Orthodox/Catholic investigation)

**Tension:** Is Christ unique (the only Incarnation) or exemplary (one avatar among many)? The Traditionalist question — perennialism or particularity — remains unresolved.

**Note:** This determines everything downstream. Must be resolved.

---

### III. Anthropology: What Is Man?

**Status:** ◐ Articulated
**Document:** `inst-credo-anthropology`
**Action Required:** Clarify archetype-theology relationship

**Current Position:**
- Man has archetypal structure: King, Warrior, Magician, Lover
- These are real structures of the psyche, not merely useful models
- Man is fallen but redeemable — Christian anthropology
- Human telos is integration — the "full mature masculine"
- Hierarchy is natural — some are fit to govern, some are not

**Self-Diagnosis:**
- Magician dominant (90%)
- Warrior underdeveloped (core growth edge)
- King integrating
- Lover moderate

**Tension:** Are archetypes created structures (like natural law) or something else? How does Jung relate to Christian anthropology?

---

### IV. Epistemology: How Do We Know?

**Status:** ◐ Strong
**Document:** `inst-credo-epistemology`
**Action Required:** State authority structure

**Current Position:**
- Four kinds of knowing: propositional, procedural, perspectival, participatory
- Modernity over-indexes on propositional; participatory knowing is the goal
- Encounter is a valid mode of knowledge (the conversion experience proves this)
- Genealogical thinking: "how did we get here" structures inquiry
- Philological excavation: etymology reveals what surfaces conceal
- Gnosis — knowledge that transforms the knower

**Tension:** When reason and revelation conflict, which wins? When excavation contradicts Church teaching, what do you do?

---

### V. Ethics: What Is Good?

**Status:** ◐ Articulated via Ilyin
**Document:** `inst-credo-ethics`
**Action Required:** Define red lines

**Current Position:**
- "I would rather bear my sin to act in good intention than to not act in fear that I am in violation of the sacred."
- Grace-dependent action, not Pelagian earning
- Tragic realism — action in a fallen world always involves sin
- The statesman bears his sin, confesses, trusts grace, acts again
- Inaction is also sin — stewardship requires deployment

**Tension:** What are the red lines — sins you will not bear even for good ends? Where does "bearing sin" become "rationalizing evil"?

---

### VI. Political Philosophy: What Is Legitimate Order?

**Status:** ◐ Articulated, in tension
**Document:** `inst-credo-political`
**Action Required:** State source of authority

**Current Position:**
- Liberalism is exhausted — cannot reproduce its own conditions
- Post-liberal turn already operative
- Schmittian realism: sovereignty is capacity to decide the exception
- Hierarchy is natural and just (Traditionalist and Cavalier inheritance)
- American particularity must be respected — not European throne-and-altar
- Regional thickness within federal structure
- "Christian pluralism" — no confessional state but public order oriented toward flourishing

**Tension:** Where does authority come from? If not consent (liberal), if not blood (fascist), if not confession (integralist), then what? You accept Schmitt's descriptive analysis but reject pure decisionism. You want transcendent grounding but resist theocracy.

---

### VII. Economics: What Is Wealth For?

**Status:** ◉ Solid
**Document:** `inst-credo-economics`
**Action Required:** Resolve List/Distributist tension

**Current Position:**
- Friedrich List over Ricardo: productive capacity over exchange efficiency
- Oikonomia over chrematistics: household flourishing over unlimited accumulation
- American System tradition: Hamilton, Clay, Lincoln
- Skepticism of financialization
- Long time horizons, regional rootedness, human-scale enterprise
- Capital deployed for productive power, not financial return

**Tension:** List implies national-scale industrial policy; Distributism implies small-scale ownership. How do you hold both? At what scale should enterprise operate?

---

### VIII. Philosophy of History: What Is the Shape of Time?

**Status:** ◔ Engaged but not resolved
**Document:** `inst-credo-history`
**Action Required:** Commit to a position

**Current Position (in tension):**
- Engages Spengler: civilizational morphology, Culture → Civilization → death
- Engages Traditionalism: Kali Yuga, decline from Golden Age
- Confesses Christ: implies history moving toward consummation, not cycle

**Unresolved Question:** Are we in the Kali Yuga? If so, what does Christian hope mean within civilizational decline? Is building futile — just slowing the inevitable — or does Christian eschatology break the cycle?

Three possibilities:
1. Cycle can be broken (Christian hope)
2. Managing decline (Spenglerian resignation)
3. Both true at different levels (civilizational time vs. salvation history)

---

### IX. Eschatology: What Is the End?

**Status:** ○ Implicit
**Document:** `inst-credo-eschatology`
**Action Required:** Articulate explicitly

**Current Position (implicit from Christ confession):**
- Resurrection of the body
- Judgment
- Heaven and hell
- New creation

**Not Yet Articulated:**
- What actually happens after death?
- What is heaven? What is hell? States, places, both?
- What is the resurrection of the body — continuity of this body, or something else?
- What is the new creation — restoration of Eden, or something genuinely new?

---

### X. Ecclesiology: Where Is the Church?

**Status:** ◔ Diagnosed but not resolved
**Document:** `inst-credo-ecclesiology`
**Action Required:** Make concrete decision

**The Journey:**
- Baptist Protestant background
- Learned much Calvinism
- Recognized historical Christian practices from 1st century did not correspond with Calvinist and evangelical beliefs
- Investigated Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy

**Current Diagnosis:**
- Protestantism rejected sacramental mystery
- Rome post-Vatican II disrupted
- Orthodoxy has strongest claim but ethnic/compromised
- The Orthodox answer to Evola (synergy, theosis) resonates

**Not Yet Decided:**
- "Orthodoxy is interesting" is not a position
- "We will attend _____ parish and submit to _____ bishop" is a position
- This admits no refinement — only decision

**Note:** Lee Kuan Yew's constructed advice: "Sit in the Divine Liturgy. Not as tourism. As investigation. Then decide."

---

## Priority Order

### Blocking (resolve first)

1. **Ecclesiology** — admits no refinement, only decision. Determines Sunday morning.
2. **Theology** — Christ's uniqueness determines everything downstream.

### Second Priority (resolve tensions)

3. **Political Philosophy** — source of authority question
4. **Philosophy of History** — Spengler vs. Christian hope

### Third Priority (consolidate)

5. Metaphysics
6. Anthropology
7. Epistemology
8. Ethics
9. Economics

### Fourth Priority (articulate from implicit)

10. Eschatology

## The Test

By sabbatical's end:

> Can you state each position instantly if asked? Not "I'm exploring..." but "I believe X."

This index tracks progress toward that goal. When all ten categories show ◉, the credo is complete.
