**Type:** Domain Framework
**Perspective:** Philosophical Genealogy
**Source:** Greek agon, Nietzsche, Burckhardt

## The Concept

*Agon* — contest, struggle, competition. But not zero-sum destruction. The Greek agon was generative: identity formed *through* contest, not prior to it.

You do not know who you are and then compete. You discover who you are *by* competing. The contest reveals.

## The Structure

| Agonal | Non-Agonal |
|--------|------------|
| Identity through contest | Identity before contest |
| Opponent as necessary | Opponent as obstacle |
| Winning reveals excellence | Winning eliminates rival |
| Ongoing relationship | Terminal victory |
| Mutual elevation | Zero-sum extraction |

The Greek athletic contests, dramatic competitions, philosophical debates — all agonal. You needed worthy opponents. Destroying them would destroy the field that made your excellence legible.

## Modern Degradation

Contemporary competition tends toward elimination rather than revelation:
- **Market competition:** Drive rivals to bankruptcy, then monopolize
- **Political competition:** Destroy opponents' legitimacy, not just defeat them
- **Academic competition:** Status hoarding, not mutual sharpening
- **Social media:** Performative destruction of the other side

The agonal frame disappears when victory means ending the contest rather than winning it.

## The Diagnostic Questions

1. **Does victory end the game or continue it?** Agonal contests are iterated. Terminal victory is anti-agonal.
2. **Does the opponent's excellence elevate or threaten you?** Agonal opponents make your victory meaningful.
3. **Is identity at stake or just resources?** Agonal contests form the self. Mere resource competition doesn't.
4. **What happens to the loser?** Agonal loss is honorable and educative. Anti-agonal loss is elimination.

## Recovery Patterns

- **Worthy rivals:** Actively cultivating strong opposition
- **Iterated games:** Designing for ongoing contest, not final victory
- **Excellence recognition:** Honoring opponents' achievements genuinely
- **Agonal friendship:** Relationships structured through productive conflict
- **Sharpening cultures:** Communities where challenge is care

## Deployment

When analyzing competition, conflict, or identity formation:
1. Is identity formed through the contest or assumed prior?
2. What happens to losers — education or elimination?
3. Would destroying opponents destroy the field?
4. Is this iterable or terminal?
5. Where has the agonal collapsed into mere antagonism?`,

    content: `# Context as Weaving

**Type:** Domain Framework
**Perspective:** Linguistic Recovery
**Source:** Latin contextus, from con- (together) + texere (to weave)

## The Excavation

Context is not a container. It's not "background information." The word comes from weaving — *contextus*, the joining together of threads.

Context is what you weave together. Every element added creates relational possibilities with every other element present. The text is the fabric. The context is the weaving that produced it.

## The Drift

Modern usage: "Let me give you some context" = "Here's background information"

This treats context as a container you pour information into. But weaving is active. You don't have context; you make it. The quality of the weave determines what can be seen.

## The Distinction

| Context as Container | Context as Weaving |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Information added | Relations created |
| Static background | Active production |
| More is better | Quality of weave matters |
| Precedes the work | Is the work |
| Neutral | Shapes what's sayable |

## The Operational Meaning

If context is weaving:
- Adding information isn't automatically helpful — a bad thread ruins the fabric
- The order of introduction matters — weaving is sequential
- Some contexts make things visible that others hide — the loom constrains the pattern
- Context is a skill, not a state — you get better at weaving

## Application to Conversation

Every conversation weaves a context. The elements present create relational possibilities:
- What vocabulary is live?
- What frameworks are active?
- What's salient vs. backgrounded?
- What's speakable within this weave?

The production model: **Context is the loom. The artifact is the fabric.**

The loom constrains what patterns are possible. Choosing what to weave into context is choosing what can be made.

## Deployment

When preparing for thinking, writing, or dialogue:
1. What threads do I need present? (Not "what information" — what *active elements*)
2. What order of introduction creates the best relational field?
3. What should stay out? (Some threads tangle the weave)
4. What becomes visible/sayable with this context that wasn't before?
5. The governing question: What does this make salient?`,

## The Frames

### By Capacity
What can you do with it?

| Capacity | Question |
|----------|----------|
| Diagnosis | Can you identify what's happening? |
| Articulation | Can you say what's happening? |
| Reading | Can you interpret what others have made? |
| Structuring | Can you organize material into form? |
| Inhabiting | Can you live inside the framework? |

### By Acquisition
How do you get it?

| Mode | Method |
|------|--------|
| Study | Encounter texts, absorb propositional content |
| Practice | Repeated exercise, build procedural capacity |
| Production | Make things, develop through output |

### By Aspect
What dimension are you working in?

| Aspect | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Meaning | What does it signify? |
| Structure | How is it organized? |
| Substance | What is it made of? |
| Relation | How does it connect? |

### By Granularity
What level of abstraction?

| Level | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| Meta | About the system itself |
| Domain | A field of practice |
| Instrument | A specific tool |
| Instance | A particular case |

### By Knowing Type
Which of the four knowings?

| Type | Character |
|------|-----------|
| Propositional | That — facts, information |
| Procedural | How — skills, capacities |
| Perspectival | What — salience, attention |
| Participatory | Who — identity, mutual recognition |

## The Diagnostic Pattern

Upper-left strong: conceptual, meaning, meta, propositional
Lower-right weak: material, substance, instance, participatory

Curriculum builds upper-right. Practice builds lower half.

## Deployment

When diagnosing a project, skill, or situation:
1. Run it through multiple frames
2. Note where it clusters
3. Identify what's missing
4. The gap is the work`,

    content: `# Etymon Method

**Type:** Toolkit Framework
**Function:** Excavate degraded concepts through philological analysis

## The Structure

**Excavation → Drift → Recovery**

Each video follows this arc. The excavation uncovers what the word originally meant — not as trivia, but as operational capacity that was once available. The drift traces how that meaning degraded, usually through abstraction, institutionalization, or metaphor collapse. The recovery asks: what would it look like to have this capacity back?

## The Operators

Operators structure the excavation. They're not exhaustive — they're generative.

| Operator | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **VERSUS** | Draws distinction | Oikonomia VERSUS Chrematistics |
| **AS** | Recovers original sense | Tutor AS guardian |
| **WITHOUT** | Names what's lost | Credit WITHOUT trust |
| **BEFORE** | Temporal excavation | Alliance BEFORE empire |
| **FROM** | Traces derivation | Capital FROM cattle |
| **FOR** | Names the telos | Education FOR what? |
| **TO** | Direction of drift | Inquiry TO record |
| **THROUGH** | Method of recovery | Meaning THROUGH etymology |
| **WITHIN** | Situates in context | Economy WITHIN household |
| **AGAINST** | Marks opposition | Accumulation AGAINST limits |
| **OF** | Genitive relation | History OF history |
| **BEHIND** | What's concealed | The body BEHIND corporation |
| **AND** | Conjunction that reveals | Debt AND guilt |
| **OR** | False equivalence | Wealth OR money |

## The Question

Not "what does this word mean?" but "what capacity did this word once carry that we no longer have access to?"

## Deployment

When producing an Etymon instance:
1. Identify the degraded term
2. Excavate the etymological root (Latin, Greek, or further)
3. Reconstruct the operational meaning
4. Trace the drift mechanism (how did it degrade?)
5. Articulate what recovery would look like
6. Select the operator that best structures the excavation`,

    content: `# The Four Knowings

**Type:** Domain Framework
**Perspective:** Philosophical Genealogy
**Source:** Vervaeke, Awakening from the Meaning Crisis

## The Framework

Knowing is not one thing. Four distinct types, each with its own acquisition path and failure mode:

| Type | Character | Acquired By | Lost By |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Propositional** | That — facts, claims, information | Study, instruction | Forgetting, misinformation |
| **Procedural** | How — skills, capacities, abilities | Practice, repetition | Atrophy, interference |
| **Perspectival** | What — salience, attention, what stands out | Exposure, habituation | Flattening, wrong salience |
| **Participatory** | Who — identity, mutual recognition, being known | Relationship, initiation | Alienation, broken recognition |

## The Integration Problem

Modern education privileges propositional knowing almost exclusively. You can know *that* the French Revolution happened, but not *how* to think historically, not *what* matters about it, not *who* you become by engaging with it.

Wisdom requires integration across all four. Information without capacity is trivia. Capacity without salience is technique. Salience without identity is observation. Identity without information is delusion.

## The Diagnostic Application

For any learning, skill, or transformation:

**Propositional:** What facts, concepts, vocabulary must be acquired?
**Procedural:** What must be practiced until fluent?
**Perspectival:** What should become salient that wasn't before?
**Participatory:** Who do you become? What community recognizes this?

## Context Across the Four Knowings

Context itself operates differently at each level:

| Knowing Type | Context Function | What Good Context Does | Degradation Mode |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Propositional | Information present | Right facts available | Overload, contradiction |
| Procedural | Capacities activated | Right skills live | Wrong skills active, skill absence |
| Perspectival | Salience landscape | Right things stand out | Undifferentiated field, false salience |
| Participatory | Conditions of mutual knowing | Genuine dialogue possible | Broken participation, mutual confusion |

## The Curriculum Pattern

Part I (Philosophical Genealogy) gave: vocabulary for meaning, salience for fragmentation, genealogical method
Part II (Linguistic Recovery) gives: etymological procedure, salience for drift, loving attention to texts
Part III (Economic Genealogy) will give: reading financial structures, salience for arrangements and positions
Part IV (Legal Grammar) will give: drafting and interpreting, salience for what binds and enforces

Each part develops all four knowings, but with different emphasis.

## Deployment

When designing learning, evaluating understanding, or diagnosing confusion:
1. Identify which knowing type is at stake
2. Check if the acquisition method matches the knowing type
3. Look for integration failures — strong in one type, absent in others
4. The governing question applies: What does this make salient?`,

    content: `# Invariants/Variants

**Type:** Toolkit Framework
**Function:** Distinguish what's fixed from what's open in any system

## The Method

Every system has:
- **Invariants:** What cannot change without breaking the system
- **Variants:** What can expand, contract, or transform

The power is in correctly identifying which is which.

## The Questions

1. What breaks if this changes? → Invariant
2. What can grow without breaking anything? → Variant
3. What looks fixed but is actually arbitrary? → False invariant
4. What looks open but actually constrains everything? → Hidden invariant

## Application Pattern

| Domain | Invariant | Variant |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Document Types | The five types (source, note, framework, instance, index) | Which documents exist |
| Framework Kinds | Toolkit vs Domain distinction | Which frameworks exist |
| Perspectives | That they're "ways of seeing" | Which perspectives, how many |
| Output Channels | That they're "where work goes" | Which channels exist |
| The Governing Question | "What does this make salient?" | Everything else |

## Common Errors

**Treating variants as invariants:** Refusing to add new perspectives because "the four-part curriculum is complete"

**Treating invariants as variants:** Trying to add a sixth document type because "why not?"

**Missing hidden invariants:** Not noticing that a "flexible" system actually depends on an unstated assumption

## Deployment

When designing or analyzing a system:
1. List what seems fixed
2. List what seems open
3. Test each: what actually breaks?
4. The false invariants are where innovation hides
5. The hidden invariants are where fragility hides`,

    content: `# Oikonomia vs Chrematistics

**Type:** Domain Framework
**Perspective:** Economic Genealogy
**Source:** Aristotle, Politics Book I

## The Distinction

Aristotle saw two orientations toward wealth:

| Oikonomia | Chrematistics |
|-----------|---------------|
| Household management | Wealth-getting |
| Bounded by need | Unbounded accumulation |
| Wealth as means | Wealth as end |
| Natural | Unnatural |
| Has a telos | Telos-less |
| Knows when to stop | Cannot stop |

The Greek *oikos* (household) + *nomos* (law/management) = the law of the household. Economics was originally about managing a bounded domain toward flourishing.

Chrematistics (*chrema* = wealth, possession) is the art of acquisition itself. When acquisition becomes its own end, there is no limit principle. You cannot have "enough" because there is no "for what."

## The Diagnostic Questions

When examining any economic arrangement:

1. **Where are the limits?** What constrains accumulation? If nothing — chrematistic.
2. **What is the telos?** Accumulation for what? If "more" — chrematistic.
3. **Who is the household?** Whose flourishing does this serve? If no one's — chrematistic.
4. **What counts as enough?** Is there a satiation point? If not — chrematistic.

## The Drift

Modern "economics" lost the oikonomia root entirely. The discipline became the study of unlimited wants meeting scarce means — chrematistics by definition. The question "what is wealth for?" became unanswerable within the frame.

The household disappeared. The corporation has no oikos — no bounded community whose flourishing it serves. Growth became the only metric because there is no telos against which to measure sufficiency.

## Recovery Patterns

What would oikonomic arrangements look like today?

- **Businesses with sufficiency targets** — "We want to reach X revenue and stay there"
- **Steward ownership** — Purpose lock, profit cap, non-extractive
- **Cooperative structures** — The enterprise serves members, not capital
- **Place-based enterprise** — Bounded by geography, accountable to community
- **Family business succession** — Intergenerational time horizon changes what "growth" means

## Deployment

When analyzing an enterprise, investment, or economic policy:
1. Apply the four diagnostic questions
2. Trace what happens as scale increases — does the arrangement stay oikonomic or drift chrematistic?
3. Identify who the implicit "household" is (or notice its absence)
4. Ask what "enough" would look like — if the question is unanswerable, you've found the problem`,

**Type:** Toolkit Framework
**Function:** Extract signal from annual report noise

## What a 10-K Is

SEC-mandated annual report. Public companies must file. Contains:
- Business description
- Risk factors
- Financial statements
- Management discussion (MD&A)
- Legal proceedings
- Executive compensation

The form is standardized. The content reveals.

## The Reading Order

Don't start at the beginning. Start where signal concentrates:

| Priority | Section | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| 1 | Risk Factors | Legal requirement to disclose what could go wrong. Reveals what management actually worries about. |
| 2 | MD&A | Management's narrative. Compare to last year — what changed? What didn't they mention? |
| 3 | Segment Data | Where does money actually come from? Which parts are growing/shrinking? |
| 4 | Cash Flow Statement | Harder to manipulate than income statement. Follow the cash. |
| 5 | Notes to Financial Statements | The footnotes hold the bodies. Accounting policy changes, contingencies, related party transactions. |
| 6 | Business Description | Usually boilerplate, but first read establishes what they claim to do. |

## The Diagnostic Questions

- **What's the business model?** How do they make money? (Not what they sell — how revenue converts to profit)
- **What are the unit economics?** Revenue per customer, cost to acquire, lifetime value
- **Where's the moat?** What stops competition? (Often: nothing)
- **What's the capital structure?** Debt load, interest coverage, covenant headroom
- **What changed?** Compare to prior year. New risks? Removed risks? Segment changes?
- **What's unsaid?** Compare to competitors' 10-Ks. What do they disclose that this one doesn't?

## Red Flags

- Revenue recognition policy changes
- Related party transactions
- Frequent "non-recurring" charges that recur
- Growing gap between net income and operating cash flow
- Inventory growing faster than sales
- Receivables growing faster than revenue
- Audit firm change
- CFO departure

## Deployment

When reading a 10-K:
1. Download from SEC EDGAR (not company website — you want the official filing)
2. Ctrl+F "risk" — read entire risk factors section
3. Ctrl+F "significant" — find what management calls significant
4. Read MD&A looking for tone shifts from prior year
5. Pull cash flow statement, trace operating cash flow trend
6. Check footnotes for anything that surprises
7. Note three things you'd want to verify with outside sources`,

    content: `# Survey Method

## Purpose

Understand a codebase or subsystem before changing it. The Survey Method produces structural knowledge — how code is organized, what calls what, where state lives.

## Core Distinction

**Mapping vs. Modifying** — Survey is read-only investigation. You produce understanding, not changes. The output is a document that captures what you learned so you (or others) can act on it later.

## Method

### Step 1: Survey

Map the terrain. Use grep/glob to identify relevant files without reading them deeply yet.

**Output:** List of candidate files with suspected roles.

### Step 2: Core Sample

Read the 2-3 most central files. Identify:
- Entry points (where does execution begin?)
- Data flow direction (what calls what?)
- Key abstractions (what patterns are used?)
- External dependencies (APIs, databases, services)

**Output:** Understanding of the structural center.

### Step 3: Stratigraphy

Trace the layers:
- Call hierarchy (use git blame for history if helpful)
- State location (where does data live?)
- Boundary conditions (what are the edges?)

**Output:** Understanding of depth and dependencies.

### Step 4: Findings

Synthesize what you learned:
- How the subsystem works (one paragraph)
- Key files and their roles
- Data flow summary
- Dependencies (internal and external)
- Complexity hotspots

**Output:** Actionable summary.

### Step 5: Open Questions

What remains unclear? What would require deeper investigation?

**Output:** Honest assessment of knowledge gaps.

## Operators

Survey Method uses location operators:

| Operator | Reveals | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **OF** | What subsystem | Survey OF authentication |
| **WITHIN** | Scope boundary | Survey WITHIN src/editor |
| **FOR** | Purpose | Survey FOR refactoring |

## Output

Survey produces **instances** — structured documents that capture understanding of a specific codebase area.

- **Channel:** loomcommander
- **Format:** Markdown with standard sections
- **Location:** \`loomlib/docs/instance/survey-{slug}.md\`

## Boundary Conditions

**Use Survey when:**
- Before refactoring unfamiliar code
- Onboarding to a new codebase
- Before estimating work
- Debugging requires context

**Don't use Survey when:**
- You already understand the code
- The task is trivial
- You need runtime behavior (use debugging instead)

## Identity THROUGH Contest

The operator: **THROUGH** — method of formation

---

## Excavation

Greek *agon* — contest, competition, struggle. Also: the gathering where contests happened. Also: the struggle of the dramatic plot.

Not merely "conflict." The agon was a structured arena where excellence revealed itself. Athletic contests, dramatic competitions, philosophical debates, political assemblies — all agones.

The key: identity was formed *through* contest, not asserted *before* it. You did not know who you were and then compete. Competition was how you discovered who you were and showed it to others.

## The Structure

Homer's heroes needed worthy opponents. Achilles required Hector. Without a great enemy, there could be no great victory. Destroying all opponents would destroy the field that made excellence legible.

| Agonal | Anti-Agonal |
|--------|-------------|
| Identity through contest | Identity before contest |
| Opponent necessary | Opponent merely obstacle |
| Victory reveals | Victory eliminates |
| Iterated games | Terminal victory |
| Honor in loss | Shame in loss |
| Mutual elevation | Zero-sum destruction |

## Drift

**Contest → Competition → Combat → Cancellation**

1. **Agonal contest:** Identity formed through structured struggle against worthy opponents
2. **Competition:** Trying to win, opponents somewhat respected
3. **Combat:** Defeating enemies, opponent is threat
4. **Elimination:** Destroying opponents' capacity to compete at all

The terminal point: you don't defeat your opponent's argument, you make it impossible for them to speak. You don't win the contest, you end the contest by removing contestants.

## Modern Degradation

- **Platform competition:** Not winning customers, destroying rivals
- **Political discourse:** Not defeating arguments, delegitimizing speakers
- **Academic status:** Not better work, but hoarding positions
- **Social media:** Performative destruction rather than productive conflict

When "winning" means ending the game rather than succeeding within it, the agonal has collapsed.

## Recovery

What would agonal structures look like today?

- **Worthy rival cultivation:** Actively strengthening your best opponents
- **Iterated games:** Designing for ongoing contest, not final victory
- **Honor in loss:** Defeat as education, not elimination
- **Agonal friendship:** Relationships structured through challenge
- **Identity stakes:** Contests where you discover who you are, not just what you get

The question: Does this competition make everyone involved more of who they are? Or does it diminish everyone including the winner?

---

## The Compression

**AGONAL IDENTITY:** The Greeks knew that contest reveals character — you find out who you are by struggling against worthy opponents. Modern "competition" often aims to eliminate opponents entirely, ending the game rather than winning it. Recovery means restoring the productive struggle that forms identity through challenge.`,

## Prompting AS Philology

The operator: **AS** — unexpected identity

---

## The Connection

Philology: loving attention to texts, sensitivity to what words carry, awareness of how language shapes what's thinkable.

Prompting: the craft of giving language to an AI system in ways that shape its outputs.

The claim: good prompting *is* philological work. Not metaphorically. Actually.

## The Parallel

| Philological Attention | Prompting Craft |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Words carry histories | Words activate patterns |
| Connotation matters | Token associations matter |
| Context shapes meaning | Context shapes completion |
| Precision reveals capacity | Precision unlocks capability |
| Loving attention to texts | Careful attention to prompts |

The philologist knows that "context" means weaving, and this changes how they use the word. The good prompter knows that word choice activates different latent patterns, and this changes how they write prompts.

## What Prompting Teaches About Language

Working with language models reveals:
- Words are not transparent windows to meaning
- Small changes in phrasing produce large changes in output
- Context (the weave of what's present) constitutes meaning
- Language has its own tendencies, grooves, attractors

The prompter learns what the philologist knows: language is not a neutral medium. It has grain. Work with the grain and meaning flows. Work against it and things jam.

## The Inverse

Philology improves prompting:
- Etymological awareness → richer word choice
- Sensitivity to connotation → better token selection
- Understanding of drift → recognition of what words activate
- Attention to context-as-weaving → better prompt architecture

Someone who has excavated CONTEXT prompts differently than someone who thinks context is just "background information."

## The Meta-Level

This video is itself both:
- A philological excavation (of "prompting")
- A prompt (deploying the Etymon framework)

The method demonstrates itself. The Etymon project is philological prompting — or prompted philology. The distinction collapses.

---

## The Compression

**AI PROMPTING AS PHILOLOGY:** Good prompting requires exactly what philology develops — loving attention to words, sensitivity to connotation, awareness that language shapes what's thinkable. The prompter and the philologist both know that words are not transparent. This video shows the identity between two practices that look unrelated.`,

## ALLIANCE BEFORE Empire

The operator: **BEFORE** — temporal excavation

---

## Excavation

The Delian League, 478 BCE. Greek city-states allied against Persia. The treasury kept on the sacred island of Delos — neutral ground.

*Alliance:* From Old French *aliance*, from *alier* — to unite, combine. Ultimately from Latin *alligare* — to bind to.

An alliance was a binding-together of separate parties who remained separate. Horizontal. Mutual. Voluntary. Withdrawable.

The structure: autonomous members, shared treasury, common defense, collective decision-making. Athens was leader (*hegemon*), but first among equals.

## The Turn

454 BCE. Athens moved the treasury from Delos to Athens. For "safekeeping."

The alliance became an empire. The shared fund became Athenian revenue. "Contributions" became "tribute." Withdrawal became rebellion. Allies became subjects.

The form persisted — they still called it an alliance. The substance transformed. What was horizontal became vertical. What was voluntary became compulsory. What was mutual became extractive.

## Drift

**Alliance → Hegemony → Empire**

The same pattern repeats:
- NATO: mutual defense treaty → American command structure
- EU: common market → supranational governance
- Platforms: "partners" → dependent suppliers
- Franchises: "business opportunity" → controlled operators

The tell: When can you leave? If exit is impossible, expensive, or punished — you're not in an alliance. You're in an empire that calls itself an alliance.

## The Diagnostic Questions

For any "alliance," "partnership," "coalition," or "network":

1. **Where's the treasury?** Who holds the shared resources?
2. **What does exit cost?** Can members leave without punishment?
3. **Who decides?** Is governance genuinely shared or formally shared?
4. **What's the direction of flow?** Do resources move between members or toward a center?
5. **What vocabulary is used?** "Partner" and "ally" can mask "subject" and "tributary."

## Recovery

What would genuine alliance require?

- **Distributed treasury:** Shared resources not held by the hegemon
- **Exit rights:** Withdrawal possible without destruction
- **Rotating leadership:** Hegemony as temporary, not permanent
- **Mutual benefit accounting:** Clear tracking of who gives and gets
- **Vocabulary discipline:** Calling empire "empire" when that's what it is

---

## The Compression

**ALLIANCE TO EMPIRE:** The Delian League moved the treasury and became the Athenian Empire. The binding-together became subjection. Every "partnership" risks this drift — horizontal to vertical, mutual to extractive, voluntary to compulsory. The diagnostic: Can you leave?`,

## CAPITAL FROM Cattle

The operator: **FROM** — traces derivation

---

## I. THE WORD

**Latin:** *caput* — head
**Medieval Latin:** *capitale* — property, stock, principal sum
**The bridge:** *capita* — heads of cattle, counted individually
**Related:** *pecuniary* from *pecus* (cattle); *fee* from Germanic *fehu* (livestock)

---

## II. EXCAVATION

### The Head

*Caput* is the head. The chief thing. What sits at the top. Capital punishment is losing your head. The capital city is where the head of state sits.

The head is where life is. Where decision happens. Where the face meets the world.

### The Cattle

Wealth was counted in heads. *Capita*. How many head of cattle do you own?

This is not metaphor — it's the literal origin of countable wealth. Cattle were:
- **Moveable** (unlike land)
- **Countable** (unlike grain in a silo)
- **Reproductive** (they make more of themselves)
- **Mortal** (they die, they require care, they have limits)

Money remembers animals. The head count was the wealth count. Your *capital* was your heads.

### The Principal

When money lending formalized, the principal sum was called *capitale*. The interest was the increase, the offspring. But the capital was the head — the chief thing.

This preserves the cattle logic: the principal is the breeding stock. Interest is what it produces. You don't eat the breeding stock.

---

## III. DRIFT

### From Heads to Fund

Capital stops being countable heads and becomes an abstract fund. Not "300 head of cattle" but "a capital of 300 pounds." The abstraction seems innocent. But cattle exist somewhere. They require pasture. They get sick. They die. A "fund" floats free.

### From Mortal to Immortal

Cattle die. Every rancher knows the herd must be maintained, replaced, renewed. Wealth-as-cattle has a built-in horizon. It requires *tending*.

Capital-as-fund doesn't die. It can compound infinitely. The logic of the livestock — bounded by biology, by carrying capacity — disappears. This is when chrematistics wins.

### From Object to Subject

The deepest drift: capital becomes an *agent*.

"Capital seeks returns." "Capital flows to opportunity." "Capital demands efficiency."

We speak as if capital *does things*. The human holding capital disappears. Capital itself becomes the protagonist. When capital is the subject, people become the means.

### From Stock to Logic

Final form: "capitalism." Not capital as something you have, but capital as *organizing principle*. The word no longer means your heads of cattle. It means the system. The totality.

---

## IV. FOR PART III: READING THE BALANCE SHEET

**Assets vs. Capital:** Assets are what the firm *has*. Capital appears on the right side — how assets were *funded*. Debt capital (someone else's heads, lent). Equity capital (owners' heads, at risk). The balance sheet maps whose heads are at stake.

**The Capital Stack:** Senior debt, junior debt, mezzanine, preferred equity, common equity. A hierarchy of heads. Who loses their head first? The stack is mortality in slow motion.

**Return on Capital:** ROC asks: what did the heads produce? High ROC means the heads are productive. Low ROC means you're running too many cattle for the grass.

---

## V. RECOVERY

Three questions to hold:

1. **Whose head is this?** When you read "capital," ask: who decides its deployment? Who bears the consequences?
2. **What's the carrying capacity?** How much capital can this system support before overgrazing?
3. **What tending does it require?** Capital deployed in a business requires management, maintenance, reinvestment. What happens if it isn't tended?

---

## VI. THE SCRIPT STRUCTURE

**Hook:** "Capital" means head. As in: decapitate. As in: the heads of cattle your grandfather counted. Somewhere between the ranch and the Bloomberg terminal, the head disappeared.

**Excavation:** The Latin, the cattle, the principal sum. What the word knew.

**Drift:** Fund replaces herd. Immortality replaces mortality. Agent replaces object. System replaces stock.

**Stakes:** When capital loses its head, we stop asking whose. The faceless fund seems to have its own desires. But capital is someone's heads. Recovering the head means recovering the person.

**Recovery:** Three questions. Whose head? What's the carrying capacity? What tending?

**Close:** The rancher counted heads because heads could be lost. Capital that can't be lost, that doesn't die, that tends itself — that's not wealth. That's something else. The word remembers what we've forgotten.

---

## The Compression

**CAPITAL:** From heads of cattle to abstract accumulation. Living wealth became undying wealth. The herd that could die became the fund that compounds forever. Recovery means remembering that real capital is mortal — and asking what dies when it dies.`,

## The Meta-Video

The operator: **OF** — the method applied to itself

---

## Excavation

*Philology:* Greek *philos* (loving) + *logos* (word, speech, reason). The love of words. The love of *logos*.

Not linguistics (the science of language). Not literary criticism (the interpretation of texts). Philology was a mode of attention — loving attention to texts, to words, to what language carries.

*Cartography:* Greek *khartēs* (papyrus leaf, map) + *graphein* (to write). The writing of maps.

Cartography of philology: mapping the territory of loving attention to words.

## The Method as Territory

The Etymon project is itself a philological act. Each video performs what it describes:
- **Excavation:** Digging to the root
- **Drift:** Tracing the degradation
- **Recovery:** Asking what capacity was lost

This video maps that method. It's the legend that makes the other maps readable.

## What Philology Notices

The philologist attends to:
- **Etymology:** Where did this word come from?
- **Semantic drift:** How has meaning changed?
- **Connotation loss:** What associations have faded?
- **Operational decay:** What could you *do* with this word that you can't do now?
- **False friends:** Words that look the same but mean different things across time

## The Cadre Question

Who is philological work for?

The "cadre" — post-tribal, action-oriented, 25-40, seeking frameworks not team membership. People who want to *see* better, not just know more. Who suspect that degraded language is part of why things feel stuck.

Philology gives them diagnostic tools. When someone says "context," you hear "weaving." When they say "capital," you hear "cattle." The excavations change what you notice.

## Deployment

This video orients viewers to the channel:
1. What philology is (loving attention to words)
2. What the method is (excavation → drift → recovery)
3. What the operators do (structure the excavations)
4. What the payoff is (transformed seeing, not just knowledge)
5. How to use the videos (diagnostic tools, not trivia)

**Type:** Instance
**Frameworks:** Etymon Method, Context as Weaving
**Output:** Etymon
**Status:** Verified

## CONTEXT AS Weaving

The operator: **AS** — recovers original sense

---

## Excavation

Latin *contextus* — a joining together, connection. Past participle of *contexere*: to weave together.

*Con-* (together) + *texere* (to weave).

The same root gives us *text* and *textile*. A text was woven. Context was the weaving-together that produced it. Context is not a space that holds things — it's the **act of interweaving**.

---

## Drift

**Weaving → Surrounding → Container → "Background"**

1. **Weaving together:** Active creation of relational structure
2. **What surrounds:** The circumstances around a thing
3. **Container:** The box you put information in
4. **Background:** Stuff you mention before the real content

Modern usage: "Let me give you some context" = "Here is information that precedes what I actually want to say."

The "context window" metaphor completes the drift: context as container with size limits. Fill it or don't. The question becomes quantitative. This loses the relational logic entirely.

---

## What the Drift Costs

Each element added creates relational possibilities with every other element. You're not filling a bucket. You're adding threads to a loom. The wrong thread doesn't just take up space — it tangles the entire weave.

If context is a container:
- More information is always better
- Order doesn't matter
- Context is separate from content
- Anyone can provide context

If context is weaving:
- Quality of relation matters more than quantity
- Order of introduction shapes what patterns emerge
- Context *is* the structure that makes content meaningful
- Weaving is a skill

---

## ATTENTION: Stretching Toward

The transformer architecture uses "attention mechanisms." Etymology: Latin *attendere*, "to stretch toward" (*ad-* to + *tendere* to stretch).

Transformers "overallocate attention to irrelevant context." This is the failure of **discriminate attention** — stretching toward everything present rather than toward what matters.

If you put twenty things in context, the model stretches toward all twenty. Chekhov's gun: the model assumes everything present must be used.

Minimal CLAUDE.md files outperform bloated ones. Not because of token limits — because of attention distribution.

---

## Recovery

Context-as-weaving recovers:

1. **Relational thinking:** The question isn't "does this fit?" but "what relations does this introduce?"

2. **Pruning as essential craft:** If context is weaving, pruning is *part of the making* — deciding which threads don't belong in this fabric.

3. **The 20-turn cliff as pattern collapse:** Where the weave becomes too dense. Too many threads crossing too many other threads. The fabric can no longer hold a coherent pattern. It's not token exhaustion — it's relational overload.

---

## The Production Model

**Context is the loom. The artifact is the fabric.**

You don't "give context." You weave it. The quality of what can be made depends on the quality of the weave.

---

## The Compression

**CONTEXT:** From weaving-together to container. The active creation of relational structure became passive information storage. Recovery means remembering that context isn't background — it's the loom that makes the pattern possible.`,

## HISTORY FROM Inquiry

The operator: **FROM** — traces derivation

---

## Excavation

Greek *historia* — inquiry, knowledge from inquiry, a narrative of what was learned through inquiry.

From *histor* — one who knows, a wise man, a judge. From *eidenai* — to know, related to *idein* — to see. The witness who has *seen*.

Herodotus opens his *Histories*: "This is the display of the inquiry (*historiē*) of Herodotus of Halicarnassus."

History was not "the past." History was *inquiry into* the past. Active investigation. The historian was the one who asked questions, traveled, interviewed, compared accounts, and judged what likely happened.

## Drift

**Inquiry → Account → Record → The Past Itself**

1. **Inquiry:** Active investigation, judgment, witness
2. **Account:** The narrative produced by inquiry
3. **Record:** Documentation of what happened
4. **The past:** "History" = what occurred, not the investigation of it

Modern usage: "That's history" = "That's over." "History teaches us..." = "The past shows us..."

The inquirer disappeared. History became a container of fixed facts rather than an ongoing investigation. The question "how do we know?" became invisible.

## What the Drift Costs

If history is inquiry:
- The historian's judgment is present
- Sources are evaluated, compared, questioned
- "History" is always provisional, subject to better inquiry
- The question is "how can we find out?"

If history is the past:
- Facts are simply there to be collected
- The historian is a passive recorder
- "History" is fixed, known, unquestionable
- The question is "what happened?"

## The Methodological Loss

Herodotus judged sources. He said "I am obliged to report what is said, but I am not obliged to believe it." He compared accounts. He noted when stories conflicted.

The historian-as-inquirer knew that evidence was incomplete, witnesses unreliable, accounts interested. Inquiry meant wrestling with that uncertainty.

The historian-as-recorder assumes the past is accessible. Just find the documents. History becomes data retrieval.

## Recovery

What would history-as-inquiry look like?

- **Visible judgment:** Historians showing their reasoning, not hiding behind "the facts"
- **Source criticism foregrounded:** How do we know what we claim to know?
- **Inquiry as ongoing:** "History" as verb, not just noun
- **The histor restored:** The one who asks, investigates, sees, judges

---

## The Compression

**HISTORY:** From inquiry to record. Herodotus investigated, judged, and displayed his inquiry. Modern "history" means the past itself — a container of facts. Recovery means restoring the inquirer: the one who asks how we know, compares sources, and judges what likely happened.`,

**Method:** Survey Method (static analysis)

---

## Survey

Relevant files:
- \`loomlib/src/data/seed-data.ts\` — **Authoritative document definitions** (TypeScript objects)
- \`loomlib/src/data/seed.ts\` — Seeds empty DB, updates managed frameworks
- \`loomlib/src/data/db.ts\` — IndexedDB CRUD operations
- \`loomlib/scripts/seed.ts\` — Legacy CLI seeder (not used by app)
- \`loomlib/docs/**/*.md\` — Markdown document outputs (not connected to app)

---

## Core Sample

### Entry Points

**There is no sync mechanism.** The data flow is:

\`\`\`
seed-data.ts (TypeScript)
       ↓
   seedIfEmpty() + updateManagedFrameworks()
       ↓
   IndexedDB
       ↓
   Browser renders
\`\`\`

Markdown files in \`loomlib/docs/\` are **orphaned** — they exist on disk but have no path into IndexedDB.

### Data Flow

\`\`\`
Currently:
┌──────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐
│ seed-data.ts     │ ───► │ IndexedDB        │
│ (TypeScript)     │      │ (Browser)        │
└──────────────────┘      └──────────────────┘

NOT connected:
┌──────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐
│ loomlib/docs/    │ ──X──│ IndexedDB        │
│ (Markdown)       │      │ (Browser)        │
└──────────────────┘      └──────────────────┘
\`\`\`

### Key Abstractions

1. **seedData array** (\`seed-data.ts:6\`) — Static TypeScript array of \`SeedDoc\` objects
2. **seedIfEmpty()** (\`seed.ts:19\`) — Only seeds if IndexedDB is empty
3. **updateManagedFrameworks()** (\`seed.ts:42\`) — Updates 8 specific framework IDs on every load
4. **MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS** (\`seed.ts:6-17\`) — Hardcoded list of frameworks that auto-update

---

## Stratigraphy

### Call Hierarchy

\`\`\`
main.ts:init()
  ├── seedIfEmpty()
  │     └── if (getAllDocs().length === 0)
  │           └── for doc in seedData: putDoc(doc)
  │
  └── updateManagedFrameworks()
        └── for id in MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS
              └── if content changed: putDoc(updated)
\`\`\`

### State Location

| State | Location | Update Mechanism |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Document definitions | \`seed-data.ts\` | Manual TypeScript editing |
| Persisted documents | IndexedDB \`loomlib.documents\` | App UI or seed functions |
| Markdown outputs | \`loomlib/docs/*.md\` | Claude Code commands |

### Boundary Conditions

**The gap:**
- Documents created via \`/loomlib:*\` commands go to \`loomlib/docs/\`
- Documents displayed in the app come from \`seed-data.ts\` → IndexedDB
- **These are disconnected systems**

---

## Findings

**There is no sync command.** Loomlib currently has two completely separate data stores:

1. **seed-data.ts** — The authoritative source that populates IndexedDB. Documents here appear in the app. This file is manually maintained TypeScript.

2. **loomlib/docs/** — Where \`/loomlib:*\` commands write markdown files. These files are never read by the app.

The survey document we created (\`survey-loomlib-startup.md\`) exists at \`loomlib/docs/instance/survey-loomlib-startup.md\` but will **never appear in the app** because:
- The app only reads from IndexedDB
- IndexedDB only gets data from \`seed-data.ts\`
- \`seed-data.ts\` doesn't know about markdown files

The current workflow requires manual intervention:
1. \`/loomlib:instance\` writes to \`loomlib/docs/\`
2. Human manually copies content into \`seed-data.ts\`
3. App rebuild picks up new data
4. IndexedDB updates on next load

### Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| \`src/data/seed-data.ts\` | **Single source of truth** for app data |
| \`src/data/seed.ts\` | Populates IndexedDB from seed-data.ts |
| \`loomlib/docs/\` | **Orphaned** markdown outputs |

### Dependencies

- **Internal:** App depends entirely on seed-data.ts for document content
- **External:** None — no markdown parser, no file system access

### Complexity Hotspots

- **seed-data.ts is 1877 lines** and growing — all documents are manually maintained in TypeScript
- **No validation** between markdown YAML frontmatter and TypeScript types
- **Drift risk** — markdown files can diverge from seed-data.ts entries

---

## Open Questions

1. **What should sync look like?**
   - Build-time script that parses \`loomlib/docs/*.md\` → generates \`seed-data.ts\`?
   - Runtime file system access (not possible in browser)?
   - Manual but assisted (Claude Code reads markdown, generates TypeScript)?

2. **Should seed-data.ts be generated or authored?**
   - Currently: authored (human writes TypeScript)
   - Alternative: generated from markdown (single source of truth in docs/)

3. **How to handle conflicts?**
   - What if markdown and seed-data.ts diverge?
   - Which is authoritative?

4. **Browser constraints:**
   - Browser can't read local files
   - Any sync must happen at build time or via manual process

---

## Confirmed Answer

**The survey doc we made doesn't appear in the app because there is no sync mechanism.**

The workflow Claude Code instructions describe — "markdown file → manual sync → seed-data.ts → app" — is accurate. The manual sync step currently means: copy-paste content from markdown into TypeScript by hand.

A \`/loomlib:sync\` command doesn't exist yet. It would need to:
1. Read all markdown files in \`loomlib/docs/\`
2. Parse YAML frontmatter
3. Generate/update \`seed-data.ts\` entries
4. This is a build-time operation, not runtime

---

## Resolution (2026-01-07)

**Both problems identified in this survey have been solved:**

1. **\`/loomlib:sync\` now exists** — Reads markdown files from \`loomlib/docs/\`, parses frontmatter, and generates \`seed-data.ts\`.

2. **\`syncSeedData()\` replaces the broken seeding logic** — The old \`seedIfEmpty()\` + \`updateManagedFrameworks()\` pattern was replaced with a single \`syncSeedData()\` function that:
   - Adds documents from seed-data.ts that don't exist in IndexedDB
   - Updates documents whose content has changed
   - Leaves user-created documents untouched

**New workflow:**
\`\`\`
/loomlib:instance → writes loomlib/docs/instance/foo.md
        ↓
/loomlib:sync → generates seed-data.ts from markdown
        ↓
Browser refresh → syncSeedData() adds/updates documents
        ↓
Document appears in app ✓
\`\`\`

Markdown is now the source of truth. The gap is closed.`,

The \`scripts/seed.ts\` file has its own hardcoded \`seedData\` array (970 lines) that's completely separate from \`src/data/seed-data.ts\`. It uses \`fake-indexeddb\` for Node.js but is never actually used in the build pipeline.

### Key Insight

**The browser cannot read local files.** This is why seed-data.ts exists — the content must be bundled into JavaScript at build time.

But there's a better way: **generate seed-data.ts from markdown at build time**, not via a manual Claude Code command.

---

## Stratigraphy

### Current Data Flow

\`\`\`
AUTHOR TIME:
  Human writes → loomlib/docs/*.md

MANUAL SYNC (via Claude Code):
  /loomlib:sync reads markdown
  /loomlib:sync writes seed-data.ts
  (This is the redundant step)

BUILD TIME:
  Vite bundles seed-data.ts into JS

RUNTIME:
  syncSeedData() → IndexedDB
\`\`\`

### Better Data Flow

\`\`\`
AUTHOR TIME:
  Human writes → loomlib/docs/*.md

BUILD TIME:
  npm run build:seed
    → Node script reads loomlib/docs/*.md
    → Parses YAML frontmatter
    → Generates seed-data.ts
    → Vite bundles into JS

RUNTIME:
  syncSeedData() → IndexedDB
\`\`\`

### State Location

| State | Current Location | Problem |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| Document content | docs/*.md AND seed-data.ts | Duplicated |
| Document metadata | YAML frontmatter AND TypeScript | Duplicated |
| Seed logic | scripts/seed.ts AND src/data/seed.ts | Two separate implementations |

---

## Findings

**The current architecture has unnecessary redundancy.** Markdown files are the source of truth, but their content is manually duplicated into seed-data.ts via the \`/loomlib:sync\` Claude Code command. This creates:

1. **Maintenance burden** — Every document change requires running sync
2. **Drift risk** — Markdown and TypeScript can get out of sync
3. **Wasted context** — Claude Code spends tokens copying content
4. **Two seed scripts** — \`scripts/seed.ts\` (unused) and \`src/data/seed.ts\` (browser-side)

The solution is to make \`scripts/seed.ts\` a **build-time generator** that:
1. Reads all \`loomlib/docs/**/*.md\` files
2. Parses YAML frontmatter using a library like \`gray-matter\`
3. Generates \`src/data/seed-data.ts\`
4. Runs as part of \`npm run build\`

This eliminates the need for \`/loomlib:sync\` to copy content — it would only need to verify the markdown is valid.

### Key Files

| File | Current Role | Better Role |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| \`docs/**/*.md\` | Source of truth | Source of truth (unchanged) |
| \`src/data/seed-data.ts\` | Manual copy of markdown | **Generated** from markdown |
| \`scripts/seed.ts\` | Unused legacy with hardcoded data | **Build script** that generates seed-data.ts |
| \`src/data/seed.ts\` | Browser sync to IndexedDB | Browser sync (unchanged) |

### Dependencies

**Current:**
- Claude Code for sync (manual process)
- No build-time markdown parsing

**Better:**
- \`gray-matter\` npm package for YAML frontmatter parsing
- Build script runs before Vite bundle

### Complexity Hotspots

- **scripts/seed.ts** has 970 lines of hardcoded seed data that's completely out of sync with the real documents
- **seed-data.ts** is 2300+ lines and growing — all manually maintained
- **/loomlib:sync** does work that should be automated

---

## Open Questions

1. **Should this be a Vite plugin or a prebuild script?**
   - Vite plugin: integrates with dev server, hot reload
   - Prebuild script: simpler, runs before \`vite build\`

2. **What about the existing seed-data.ts content?**
   - 27+ documents exist in seed-data.ts that don't have markdown files
   - Need to either create markdown files for them OR keep a hybrid approach

3. **Dependencies:**
   - \`gray-matter\` for YAML parsing — acceptable to add?
   - Or use a simpler regex-based parser to avoid dependencies?

4. **What happens to /loomlib:sync?**
   - Could become a validation command (check markdown is valid)
   - Or could be deprecated entirely

---

## Proposed Architecture

\`\`\`
loomlib/
├── docs/
│   ├── framework/*.md      ← Source of truth
│   ├── instance/*.md
│   ├── index/*.md
│   └── source/*.md
├── scripts/
│   └── generate-seed.ts    ← NEW: reads docs/, writes seed-data.ts
├── src/data/
│   ├── seed-data.ts        ← GENERATED (never hand-edit)
│   └── seed.ts             ← Browser sync (unchanged)
└── package.json
    scripts:
      "prebuild": "tsx scripts/generate-seed.ts"
      "build": "tsc && vite build"
\`\`\`

**Result:**
- Markdown is single source of truth
- No manual sync step
- No Claude Code command needed for content sync
- seed-data.ts is always in sync with markdown`,

## Survey

Relevant files:
- \`loomlib/src/data/seed.ts\` — Seed and update logic
- \`loomlib/src/data/seed-data.ts\` — Document definitions (just updated with 3 new docs)
- \`loomlib/src/data/db.ts\` — IndexedDB CRUD operations
- \`loomlib/src/main.ts\` — Application bootstrap

---

## Core Sample

### Entry Points

**Bootstrap sequence (main.ts:31-42):**
\`\`\`
init() →
  1. loadTheme()
  2. seedIfEmpty()           ← ONLY seeds if DB is empty
  3. updateManagedFrameworks() ← ONLY updates 8 hardcoded framework IDs
\`\`\`

### Data Flow

\`\`\`
seed-data.ts (30 documents including 3 new)
      ↓
seedIfEmpty() ← BLOCKED: DB has existing docs
      ↓
updateManagedFrameworks() ← BLOCKED: only looks at 8 specific IDs
      ↓
IndexedDB (still has old 27 documents, never gets 3 new ones)
\`\`\`

### Key Abstractions

**The problem is in seed.ts lines 6-17 and 19-24:**

\`\`\`typescript
// Only these 8 IDs get auto-updated
const MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS = [
  'fw-etymon-method',
  'fw-invariants-variants',
  'fw-diagnostic-frames',
  'fw-reading-10k',
  'fw-oikonomia-chrematistics',
  'fw-four-knowings',
  'fw-agonal-identity',
  'fw-context-weaving',
];

// seedIfEmpty() only runs when DB is empty
export async function seedIfEmpty(): Promise<boolean> {
  const existing = await getAllDocs();
  if (existing.length > 0) {  // ← BLOCKS because DB already has docs
    console.log(\`Database has \${existing.length} documents, skipping seed.\`);
    return false;
  }
  // ... never reaches seeding code
}
\`\`\`

### Call Hierarchy

\`\`\`
main.ts:init()
  │
  ├── seedIfEmpty()
  │     └── getAllDocs() returns 27 docs
  │     └── if (27 > 0) → return false  ← STOPS HERE
  │     └── (seed loop never runs)
  │
  └── updateManagedFrameworks()
        └── for id in MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS (8 IDs only)
        │     └── 'fw-survey-method' NOT in list → skipped
        │     └── 'inst-survey-*' NOT in list → skipped
        └── (only checks 8 predefined frameworks)
\`\`\`

### State Location

| State | Location | Problem |
|-------|----------|---------|
| New docs in seed-data.ts | TypeScript file | ✓ Present |
| Existing docs in IndexedDB | Browser storage | 27 docs, never cleared |
| MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS | Hardcoded array | Only 8 frameworks, no instances |

### Boundary Conditions

**Two gates block new documents:**

1. **seedIfEmpty() gate:** Only seeds if \`getAllDocs().length === 0\`. Since the DB already has documents from a previous seed, this never runs.

2. **MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS gate:** Only 8 specific framework IDs are "managed" (auto-updated). The new documents we added are:
   - \`fw-survey-method\` — NOT in the list
   - \`inst-survey-loomlib-startup\` — NOT in the list (instances never managed)
   - \`inst-survey-data-sync-gap\` — NOT in the list (instances never managed)

---

## Findings

**The sync worked correctly — seed-data.ts has the new documents.** The problem is the app's seeding logic:

1. \`seedIfEmpty()\` only runs when IndexedDB is completely empty. If you've ever loaded the app before, it already has documents, so this function returns early without adding new ones.

2. \`updateManagedFrameworks()\` only updates 8 hardcoded framework IDs. It was designed to keep core frameworks in sync with seed-data.ts, but:
   - \`fw-survey-method\` is not in the list
   - Instance documents are never managed (the list only has \`fw-*\` IDs)

**To see the new documents, the user must clear their IndexedDB** — either through browser DevTools or by calling \`_resetDB()\`. On the next page load, \`seedIfEmpty()\` will run and insert all documents including the new ones.

### Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| \`src/data/seed.ts:6-17\` | **MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS** — hardcoded list of 8 frameworks |
| \`src/data/seed.ts:19-24\` | **seedIfEmpty()** — only seeds empty DB |
| \`src/data/seed.ts:42-79\` | **updateManagedFrameworks()** — only updates listed IDs |

### Dependencies

- **Internal:** seed.ts depends on seed-data.ts for content, db.ts for storage
- **External:** Browser IndexedDB API

### Complexity Hotspots

- **MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS is manually maintained** — every new framework requires editing this list
- **No mechanism for adding new documents to non-empty DB** — sync adds to seed-data.ts but the app ignores it
- **Instance documents are never auto-updated** — they fall outside the managed framework pattern

---

## Open Questions

1. **What should the sync behavior be?**
   - Option A: Add missing documents (compare seed-data IDs to IndexedDB IDs)
   - Option B: Update all documents like managed frameworks do (compare content)
   - Option C: Full sync (add missing, update changed, optionally remove orphaned)

2. **Should all documents be "managed" or just frameworks?**
   - Currently: only 8 frameworks
   - Alternative: all documents in seed-data.ts

3. **What about user-created documents?**
   - If sync updates all seed-data docs, user edits to those docs would be overwritten
   - Need to distinguish "seed documents" from "user documents"?

4. **Immediate workaround:**
   - Clear IndexedDB in browser DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → loomlib → Delete
   - Refresh page → seedIfEmpty() runs → all 30 docs appear

---

## Root Cause Summary

\`\`\`
seed-data.ts has 30 documents (including 3 new)
                ↓
          seedIfEmpty()
                ↓
     DB has 27 docs? → YES → return (skip seeding)
                ↓
     updateManagedFrameworks()
                ↓
     Is 'fw-survey-method' in MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS? → NO → skip
     Is 'inst-survey-*' in MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS? → NO → skip
                ↓
     IndexedDB still has only 27 documents
\`\`\`

**Fix options:**
1. Add \`fw-survey-method\` to MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS (doesn't help instances)
2. Create \`seedMissingDocuments()\` function that adds docs not yet in IndexedDB
3. Make all seed-data docs "managed" (update on every load if changed)

---

## Resolution (2026-01-07)

**Fix option #3 was implemented.**

The old \`seedIfEmpty()\` + \`updateManagedFrameworks()\` pattern was replaced with a single \`syncSeedData()\` function in \`loomlib/src/data/seed.ts\`:

\`\`\`typescript
export async function syncSeedData(): Promise<{ added: number; updated: number }> {
  // For each doc in seedData:
  // - If not in IndexedDB: add it
  // - If content differs: update it
  // - User-created docs (not in seedData): untouched
}
\`\`\`

**Result:** After running \`/loomlib:sync\`, a browser refresh immediately shows new documents. No need to clear IndexedDB.

The \`MANAGED_FRAMEWORK_IDS\` array was deleted — all seed-data documents are now managed.`,

## TUTOR AS Guardian

The operator: **AS** — recovers original sense

---

## Excavation

Latin *tutor* — guardian, protector, defender. From *tueri* — to watch, guard, protect.

The tutor was not an instructor. The tutor was the one who *watched over*. In Roman law, a *tutor* was appointed to protect the interests of those who couldn't protect themselves — orphans, the young, those not yet capable of managing their own affairs.

The relationship was fiduciary. The tutor's job was to guard the ward's interests until they could guard their own. Success meant the tutor was no longer needed.

## Drift

**Tutor → Instructor → Content Deliverer**

The guardian became a teacher. The teacher became a content delivery mechanism. The fiduciary relationship disappeared entirely.

Modern "tutoring" means supplementary instruction — someone who helps you pass tests. The tutoring industry sells hours of explanation. No one asks: tutoring *toward what*? When is the student ready to not need a tutor?

The drift follows a pattern:
1. **Guardian** — watches over development toward independence
2. **Teacher** — transmits knowledge and skill
3. **Instructor** — delivers curriculum
4. **Tutor** — helps with homework

Each step loses something. The guardian's job was to *end the relationship well*. The modern tutor's job is to maintain billable hours.

## Recovery

What would tutoring-as-guardianship look like?

- **Developmental telos:** The tutor's success is measured by the student's independence, not continued dependence
- **Fiduciary structure:** The tutor's interests legally bound to the student's interests
- **Watch over, not talk at:** Attention to the whole person, not just the subject matter
- **Protection function:** Guarding the student from premature exposure, bad influences, exploitation
- **Exit criteria:** Clear markers for when guardianship ends

The question for any educational relationship: Is this structured to end well, or to perpetuate itself?

---

## The Compression

**TUTOR:** From guardian of development to vendor of explanation. The one who watches over became the one who talks at. Recovery means restoring the fiduciary structure — the tutor succeeds when they're no longer needed.`,

npm run build    → tsc && vite build
npm run preview  → vite preview  (production preview)
npm run test     → vitest run

**Application bootstrap (main.ts:31-106):**
\`\`\`
init() →
  1. loadTheme()
  2. seedIfEmpty()           ← seeds if IndexedDB empty
  3. updateManagedFrameworks() ← always updates 8 core frameworks

---

## Findings

Loomlib starts as a standard Vite application. The HTML entry point loads \`main.ts\`, which orchestrates a sequential bootstrap: theme loading from localStorage, database seeding if empty, forced update of 8 "managed" framework documents to ensure they always reflect the latest TypeScript definitions, and finally Shell initialization which creates the three main views (list, constellation, editor) and shows the list view. The application is deliberately dependency-free at runtime, relying only on browser APIs (IndexedDB, localStorage, DOM). State is divided between persistent (IndexedDB for documents, localStorage for theme) and ephemeral (current view mode, open document).

### Key Files

|------|------|
| \`package.json\` | Defines \`npm run dev\` as Vite dev server |
| \`main.ts\` | Bootstrap: theme → seed → shell → modals → keyboard |
| \`db.ts\` | IndexedDB CRUD with lazy singleton pattern |

| \`seed-data.ts\` | Authoritative document content (TypeScript) |
| \`shell.ts\` | View orchestration, keyboard shortcuts |
| \`types.ts\` | Document type, ViewMode, TypeScript interfaces |

### Dependencies

- **Internal:** Shell → ListView, ConstellationView, Editor; all views → db.ts
- **External:** Browser IndexedDB API, localStorage API

### Complexity Hotspots

- **seed-data.ts** — Single point of truth for all document content; will grow large
- **Managed framework sync** — Runs on every load, compares content for changes
- **No markdown sync** — Markdown files in \`/docs/\` are not auto-imported (manual process)

---

## Open Questions

- Does \`updateManagedFrameworks()\` need to run on every page load, or only when seed-data.ts changes?
- What's the planned mechanism for \`/loomlib:sync\` to import markdown from \`/docs/\` into \`seed-data.ts\`?
- Should theme loading block the rest of init, or can it be parallel?
- How will the app handle IndexedDB quota limits as document count grows?

---

## Resolution (2026-01-07)

**Questions 1-2 have been answered:**

1. **\`updateManagedFrameworks()\` was deleted.** It was replaced by \`syncSeedData()\`, which runs on every page load and syncs ALL seed-data documents (not just 8 hardcoded frameworks).

2. **\`/loomlib:sync\` now exists.** It reads markdown from \`loomlib/docs/\`, parses YAML frontmatter, and generates \`seed-data.ts\`.

**Updated bootstrap sequence (main.ts):**
\`\`\`
init() →
  1. loadTheme()
  2. syncSeedData()  ← replaces seedIfEmpty + updateManagedFrameworks
  3. new Shell(app)

## ACCOUNT AS Reckoning

The operator: **AS** — recovers original sense

---

## Excavation

Old French *acont* — a reckoning, a computation
From Latin *ad-* (to) + *computare* (to reckon, to count together)

Related: *count*, *compute*, *recount* (both meanings: to count again, and to tell a story)

An account is a reckoning. But reckoning isn't just arithmetic — it's **giving an account of**, rendering a story of what happened with the numbers.

---

## Drift

**Reckoning → Record → Compliance**

1. **Account (reckoning):** A rendering of what happened, a story told in numbers
2. **Account (ledger entry):** A record of transactions
3. **Account (holder):** Your relationship with an institution
4. **Accounting (profession):** Compliance, audit, tax preparation

The narrative dimension disappeared. Double-entry bookkeeping is powerful because it tells a story — every transaction has two sides, every flow has a source and destination. But modern accounting feels like compliance, not narration.

---

## Double-Entry as Narrative Technology

Pacioli's innovation (1494): every transaction affects two accounts. The books must balance. This isn't just arithmetic constraint — it's **coherence requirement**. The story must make sense. The left side and right side must tell the same tale from different angles.

An accountant, recovered, is a *narrator of what happened with the resources*.

---

## Recovery

What would accounting-as-reckoning mean?

- **Reading statements as stories:** What happened? Who did what? Where did it go?
- **Balance as coherence:** The books balance because the story is consistent
- **Audit as verification:** Not "are the numbers right?" but "does the story hold up?"
- **The accountant as narrator:** One who gives account, who can reckon with what happened

---

## The Compression

**ACCOUNT:** From reckoning to record. Double-entry is narrative technology — the books tell a story. Recovery means reading statements as accounts-of, not just accounts.

## The Body BEHIND Corporation

The operator: **BEHIND** — what's concealed

---

## Excavation

Latin *corpus* — body. *Corporare* — to form into a body. *Corporatio* — the forming of a body.

A corporation was a body made of people. The *corpus* was collective — monks, guilds, universities, towns. Groups incorporated to act as one.

The body was mortal-ish. Monasteries could outlast individual monks, guilds could outlast individual craftsmen. But the body required members. No people, no corpus.

## Drift

**Body of people → Legal person → Immortal entity → Disembodied capital**

1. **Body of people:** Collective form for common action
2. **Legal person:** The body gains legal standing distinct from members
3. **Immortal entity:** The corporation outlives all founders, members, owners
4. **Disembodied capital:** The "body" is pure financial structure; humans are inputs

The modern corporation is a body with no body. It's "incorporated" but has no *corpus*. It's a legal fiction that can own property, make contracts, sue and be sued — but cannot die, feel, or be held in quite the way persons can.

## What the Drift Costs

When corporations were bodies:
- They needed members (no people, no body)
- They could be chartered for specific purposes (the body had a telos)
- They could be dissolved (mortality was possible)
- Responsibility was locatable (humans were present)

When corporations are immortal persons:
- They persist without members (shareholders are not the body)
- Purpose is "shareholder value" (generic chrematistic telos)
- Death is rare and difficult (legal structures resist dissolution)
- Responsibility diffuses (no one is the corporation)

## The Chrematistic Turn

The corporation solved chrematistics' mortality problem. Individual accumulators die. Corporations don't. Wealth can compound beyond any human lifetime.

Limited liability solved the risk problem. You can participate in accumulation without personal exposure. Capital grows; persons are shielded.

## Recovery

What would mortal corporations look like?

- **Sunset clauses:** Corporations chartered for limited terms, requiring renewal
- **Purpose locks:** The corporate "body" has a telos beyond accumulation
- **Steward ownership:** Non-extractive, non-transferable ownership
- **Living body requirements:** Structures that require ongoing human membership
- **Death possibility:** Legal structures that can and do die

The question: What is the *corpus* — the body — of this corporation? If the answer is "nothing" or "financial structure," the word has drifted far from its root.

---

## The Compression

**CORPORATION:** From body of people to immortal legal fiction. The *corpus* was once collective — humans incorporated for common purpose. Now corporations are "bodies" with no bodies, legal persons that cannot die. Recovery means asking: what would it mean for corporations to be mortal again?

## CREDIT WITHOUT Trust

The operator: **WITHOUT** — names what's lost

---

## Excavation

Latin *credere* — to believe, to trust, to entrust. *Credo* — I believe (also the origin of "creed").

Credit was belief. To extend credit was to believe in someone — their word, their capacity to repay, their trustworthiness. The creditor believed the debtor.

Related: *credibility* (believability), *incredible* (unbelievable), *credentials* (evidence warranting belief).

The web of credit was a web of trust. Reputation mattered because credit was belief.

## Drift

**Belief → Trust → Lending → Score**

1. **Belief:** I believe in you, therefore I lend
2. **Trust:** I trust you'll repay, therefore I lend
3. **Lending:** I lend, secured by collateral or contract
4. **Score:** The algorithm rates your creditworthiness; belief is irrelevant

Modern credit is secured by mechanisms, not belief. Your credit score is a prediction, not a judgment about character. The lender doesn't need to believe in you — they need to calculate default probability.

## What the Drift Costs

When credit was belief:
- Reputation was essential (belief required social knowledge)
- Default was shameful (betrayed trust, not just broken contract)
- Credit relationships were personal (the creditor knew the debtor)
- Limits were social (you could only borrow from those who knew you)

When credit is calculation:
- Reputation is irrelevant (only data matters)
- Default is strategic (just a financial decision)
- Credit is anonymous (algorithm, not relationship)
- Limits are statistical (borrow up to the probability threshold)

## The Chrematistic Turn

Personal credit was bounded — you could only borrow from those who trusted you. Calculated credit is unbounded — as long as the math works, credit extends.

The shift from belief to calculation enabled unlimited credit expansion. No relationship required. No trust necessary. Just collateral, contracts, and credit scores.

## Recovery

What would credit-as-belief mean today?

- **Relational lending:** Credit extended based on knowledge, not scores
- **Reputation systems with memory:** Default has social, not just financial, consequences
- **Credibility requirements:** The creditor must believe, not just calculate
- **Bounded credit:** Limits based on relationship, not just collateral

The question: Would this person lend to this borrower if they had to *believe* in them? If not — if credit flows only because calculation permits — something important is missing.

---

## The Compression

**CREDIT:** From belief to calculation. The creditor once believed in the debtor — their character, their word, their trustworthiness. Modern credit requires no belief, only collateral and scores. Recovery means asking: what would it mean to extend credit only where there's genuine trust?

## Spectatorship WITHIN Hierarchy

The operator: **WITHIN** — situates in structure

---

## Excavation

*Spectator:* Latin *spectare* — to watch, to observe. One who watches.

*Hierarchy:* Greek *hieros* (sacred) + *arkhein* (to rule). Sacred rule, ordered ranks.

*Hierarchical spectatorship:* The phenomenon where watching itself is ranked. Not just who acts, but who gets to watch — and whose watching matters.

## The Shonen Pattern

Dragon Ball Z as case study:

Fights happen. But most characters don't fight — they watch. And the watchers are ranked:

1. **The fighters:** Goku, Vegeta — participants
2. **First-tier spectators:** Strong warriors who could fight but don't (Piccolo, Gohan) — their reactions validate power levels
3. **Second-tier spectators:** Weaker Z-fighters — their astonishment marks escalation
4. **Third-tier spectators:** Normal humans — total incomprehension, register only destruction
5. **Absent spectators:** Those too far away to perceive anything

The hierarchy of spectatorship *is* the power scaling system. Your ability to perceive the fight indicates your rank. When Krillin can no longer follow the action, you know the fighters have ascended.

## The Structure

| Spectator Tier | Can Perceive | Reaction | Function |
|---------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Top fighters | Everything | Engage | Participate |
| Elite spectators | Most | Analyze | Validate |
| Mid-tier spectators | Some | Astonished | Mark escalation |
| Weak spectators | Little | Overwhelmed | Register power |
| Absent | Nothing | None | Show transcendence |

## The Agonal Connection

In Greek agon, spectators mattered. The audience's recognition made victory real. Excellence required witnesses.

Shonen manga literalizes this:
- Power is meaningless without spectators who can perceive it
- Higher power requires higher-tier spectators
- The ultimate power might have *no* adequate spectators

The question: If no one can perceive your power, are you powerful? DBZ's answer is ambivalent. Beerus's power is real, but partly illegible until someone can register it.

## Recovery

The concept excavates:
- **How communities validate excellence:** Whose perception counts?
- **Spectatorship as participation:** Watching is not passive; it constitutes the event
- **Ranked perception:** Some can see what others can't
- **The problem of transcendence:** What happens when you exceed all spectators?

---

## The Compression

**HIERARCHICAL SPECTATORSHIP:** In Dragon Ball Z, watching is ranked. Your ability to perceive the fight marks your own power level. The spectator hierarchy *is* the power scaling system. This excavates how communities validate excellence — whose perception constitutes recognition.

## INTEREST FROM Being-Between

The operator: **FROM** — traces derivation

---

## Excavation

Latin *interesse* — to be between, to be among, to make a difference
*Inter-* (between) + *esse* (to be)

"It interests me" originally meant "it is between me" — it stands in my space, it concerns me, it matters to me. Interest was **what matters**.

---

## Drift

**What matters to you → Rate of return**

1. **Interest (concern):** What stands between you and indifference. What you care about.
2. **Interest (stake):** What you have at stake in an outcome.
3. **Interest (advantage):** What serves your benefit.
4. **Interest (rate):** The price of borrowed money. A percentage.

The word that meant *being-between* became the price of time. That drift explains why finance feels soulless — the word for caring became a number.

---

## The Lending Connection

When you lend money, your *interest* is in its return. The interest you charge is compensation for your interest (concern, risk, care). The word originally carried the relational logic — you're interested because you're *in between*, you're exposed, you care.

Modern interest rates float free of relationship. The rate is calculated, not felt. The being-between becomes a spread.

---

## Recovery

What would it mean to recover interest?

- **Lending as caring:** You're interested because you're exposed to this person, this project
- **Rate as relationship:** The price reflects the between-ness, not just the algorithm
- **Interest alignment:** When we say "aligned interests," we're saying "we're between the same things"

---

## The Compression

**INTEREST:** From being-between to rate of return. What matters became a percentage. Recovery means remembering that interest is exposure — you're interested because you're *in* it, standing between outcome and indifference.

## OPERATIVE AS One Who Works the Work

The operator: **AS** — recovers original sense

---

## Excavation

Latin *operari* — to work, to labor, to be busy with
From *opus* (genitive *operis*) — work, labor, but specifically: a work, a production, an opus

*Opus* is not *labor* (toil) and not *ponos* (suffering). Opus is the work that produces a *work*. An opus. The operative is the one who produces through working.

Related: *opera* (work, effort, but also the collaborative artwork), *operation*, *cooperate*

---

## Drift

**One who works → Merely functional**

1. **Operative (noun):** The one who operates, who works the mechanism, who produces
2. **Operative (adj.):** In operation, functioning, running
3. **Operational:** Merely working, merely running
4. **"The system is operative":** No agent, just status

The agent disappeared. "Operative" now means functional, running, in effect — passive. The worker became an adjective.

---

## The Displacement

When we say "operative capacity," we usually mean "ability to function." But the original sense is stronger: **the one working the work**. Not capacity abstractly, but actively producing.

"Operative capacity in Northwest Arkansas" doesn't mean *potential* to do things. It means *actual operation* — being the one who works, who produces, who makes things go.

---

## The Connection to CAPITAL

Capital without the head that operates it is exactly the drift. The faceless fund "seeks returns" — but funds don't seek. Someone operates the fund.

The operative puts the *caput* back. If capital needs a head (a decider, a risk-bearer, a responsible party), it also needs hands — someone doing the *opus*.

---

## Recovery

What would operative capacity mean, recovered?

- **Not potential but actual:** You're not building capacity to operate someday. You're operating.
- **The agent present:** When you say "operative," there's a who. Someone is working the work.
- **Production, not maintenance:** Operative isn't just "keeping things running." It's making the opus.

---

## The Diagnostic

The curriculum's diagnostic pattern: upper-left strong (conceptual, meaning, meta, propositional), lower-right weak (material, substance, instance, participatory).

OPERATIVE anchors the lower-right. It's the word for *actually doing the thing*. Recovering it means closing the gap between frameworks and operation.

---

## The Compression

**OPERATIVE:** From one who works the work to merely functional. The agent disappeared into adjective. Recovery means putting the worker back — not potential capacity, but actual operation. The one who produces the opus.

## PETTY AS Small-scale, Not Trivial

The operator: **AS** — recovers original sense

---

## Excavation

*Petty:* From French *petit* — small. Not "trivial" or "mean-spirited." *Small-scale.*

*Petty commodity production:* Production where the producer owns their means of production and sells what they make. The craftsman with their tools. The farmer with their land. Small-scale commodity production.

Marx distinguishes:
- **Simple/petty commodity production:** Producer owns means, sells product (C-M-C: commodity to money to different commodity)
- **Capitalist commodity production:** Capitalist owns means, buys labor, sells product (M-C-M': money to commodity to more money)

The petty commodity producer works *for* the sale. The capitalist works *through* the sale toward accumulation.

## Drift

**Small-scale → Inferior → Trivial**

"Petty" now means:
- Mean-spirited ("petty grievances")
- Trivial ("petty concerns")
- Inferior ("petty criminals")

The economic concept became inaudible. "Petty commodity production" sounds like "trivial" production, not "small-scale" production.

## Why It Matters

Petty commodity production is:
- **Oikonomic:** The producer works toward use, exchanging to obtain what they need
- **Bounded:** You can only produce so much with your own hands
- **Embodied:** The producer's body limits scale
- **Mortal:** The enterprise ends when the producer dies or stops

Capitalist commodity production is:
- **Chrematistic:** The goal is M' > M, accumulation without limit
- **Unbounded:** Scale limited only by capital, not producer's body
- **Disembodied:** Owners need not participate
- **Immortal:** Can outlast any individual through corporate form

## The Diagnostic

When someone says they're a "small business owner," ask:
- Do you work in the business? (Petty commodity producer)
- Or do you own a business that others work in? (Capitalist, regardless of scale)

The question isn't size. It's structure. A solo consultant is a petty commodity producer. A "small" business with employees where the owner doesn't work is not.

## Recovery

What's at stake in recovering the term:
- **Legitimacy for small-scale production:** Not inferior, just different structure
- **Alternative to capitalism/socialism binary:** Petty commodity production is neither
- **Diagnostic precision:** "Small business" conflates radically different forms
- **Oikonomic possibility:** Petty commodity production has built-in limits

---

## The Compression

**PETTY:** From small-scale to trivial. Marx's "petty commodity production" — the craftsman owning their tools — sounds like an insult. Recovery means hearing "petty" as *petit*, small-scale but not inferior. A structural alternative to both corporate capitalism and state socialism.
